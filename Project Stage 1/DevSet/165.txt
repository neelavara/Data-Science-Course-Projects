In truth, this comparo was centered around <carMake>Buick’s</carMake> handsome Regal Turbo, the newcomer on the block. We flanked it with the slightly less-expensive <carMake>Volkswagen</carMake> CC (whose turbocharged inline-four is but one cubic inch smaller than the <carMake>Buick’s</carMake>) and the more expensive <carMake>Acura</carMake> TSX fitted with the optional 280-hp V-6. Yes, we might’ve clutched fast to the base TSX’s 201-hp inline-four, but <carMake>Buick</carMake> is making a fuss about how its turboed four will tackle virtually all V-6 comers. So we decided to find out.
