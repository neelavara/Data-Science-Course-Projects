So it’s with equal parts skepticism and excitement that we approach the <carMake>Alfa Romeo</carMake> Giulia, the beachhead of <carMake>Alfa’s</carMake> return to America. Aimed squarely at the usual suspects in the compact-luxury-sedan segment, it starts at $73,595 in Quadrifoglio form, and with 505 horsepower it is equipped to take on some of the world’s best sedans. Engineered and designed in Italy, the Giulia is built on FCA’s new Giorgio rear- and all-wheel-drive platform that will also form the basis for <carMake>Alfa’s</carMake> second mooring, the Stelvio SUV.

Breaking with our usual comparison-test protocol, we brought back all the players from the last test of this genre. Ordinarily, we’d only invite the test winner, in this case the <carMake>BMW</carMake> M3, but we recalled the also-rans from that comparo as well, even though they are unchanged since their last visit. The <carMake>Cadillac</carMake> ATS-V still has a twin-turbocharged 464-hp V-6 and Nürburg­ring-developed moves; the <carMake>Mercedes-AMG</carMake> C63 S still has a sugary-sweet 4.0-liter twin-turbo V-8 that pours out 503 horsepower.
