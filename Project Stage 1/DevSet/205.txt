The <carMake>Jaguar</carMake> F-Type S is the frappuccino in this analogy, while the <carMake>Alfa Romeo</carMake> 4C is 
the espresso. Both drinks are good for different reasons, and what you order will depend on your tastes.
The two cars we have here, the 2016 <carMake>Alfa Romeo</carMake> 4C Spider and the 2016 <carMake>Jaguar</carMake> F-Type S, 
have more differences than they do commonalities.
