Toyota was really late to the game with a subcompact crossover and jealous that its arch nemesis <carMake>Honda</carMake> 
has its HR-V, it recently came out with the sharp-looking C-HR, which was supposed to be a Scion.
And everyone knows the <carMake>Toyota</carMake> <carMake>Honda</carMake> rivalry is as natural as pie versus cake, 
so of course we had to compare them to see which one is the better subcompact crossover.
