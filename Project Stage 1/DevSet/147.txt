The other three cars are all new for 2013. The aptly named Fusion fuses styling themes from several former <carMake>Ford</carMake>-owned colonies. <carMake>Aston Martin</carMake> is recalled in the face, <carMake>Jaguar</carMake> in the cab-rearward profile, and <carMake>Volvo</carMake> in the ski-jump dash. Well, why not? <carMake>Ford</carMake> paid for it all way back when, so it’s not technically stealing. A 1.6-liter EcoBoost turbocharged four-cylinder pairs with a six-speed automatic. The only Fusion available to us had $4685 in options, all electronic and comfort related (read: MyFord Touch plus leather and navigation, mainly), so it’s the luxury liner of the test.

The new, ninth-generation <carMake>Honda</carMake> Accord is 3.5 inches shorter bumper-to-bumper and about an inch tighter between the wheels than its fleshy predecessor. And this one is exactly 100 pounds lighter than the gen-eight EX-L we tested in May. The overhauled “Earth Dreams” DOHC 2.4-liter is <carMake>Honda’s</carMake> first example of direct injection in North America, while a <carMake>Honda</carMake>-built CVT is your only automatic alternative to a six-speed manual.
