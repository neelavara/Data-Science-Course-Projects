These are not those vans. Those vans are vintage <carMake>Volkswagens</carMake> or commercial <carMake>Ford</carMake> Econolines, campers and conversions as colorful and full of character as their live-in owners. These are minivans, loaded with Blu-ray players and vacuums and three rows of kid-friendly buckets and benches. These are vehicles designed for parenthood and responsibility, their owners having traded character for characters. The redesigned 2018 Odyssey is the newest minivan on the market, the fifth generation of <carMake>Honda’s</carMake> people mover. The company claims that it has made the segment’s best seller for seven years running, but <carMake>Honda</carMake> likes to count only retail sales. If you look at both retail and fleet numbers, the 2016 title went to the <carMake>Toyota</carMake> Sienna by a narrow margin; the Sienna also won our last minivan comparo in 2015.
