<carMake>Ford</carMake>’s updated 2017 Escape SE AWD also waves the fun-to-drive flag. It’s now fitted with a new 1.5-liter, turbocharged I-4, a more ergonomic interior, and revised sheetmetal. The <carMake>Toyota</carMake> RAV4 SE, best-selling in its segment, is similarly revised for the new model year. Although our gas-powered version is unchanged under the hood (a hybrid is the big news for this model year), the sheetmetal sports crisper lines and a more off-road-ready look. The field was rounded out by a two former SUV of the Year winners, both of which are unchanged as they near the end of their production cycle: the 2015-winning <carMake>Honda</carMake> CR-V Touring AWD and the 2014-winning <carMake>Subaru</carMake> Forester 2.5i Limited.
