At this moment, the worlds of the new ­<carMake>Mitsubishi</carMake> Mirage and the 2005 <carMake>Volks­wagen</carMake> Phaeton collide below $20,000. They couldn’t be less alike if one car hovered on an anti-gravity field and the other ran on cheeseburgers.

The Phaeton is the manifestation of Ferdinand Piëch’s fanaticism. Back when he was chairman of <carMake>VW</carMake>, he willed the company to build a big sedan better than any <carMake>Mercedes</carMake> or <carMake>BMW</carMake>. But the Phaeton came out looking like a supersized Passat, just another trout in the traffic stream. Combine that with the prestige-free <carMake>VW</carMake> badge and the car was instantly obscure, heading into a Stuka’s screaming divebomb of depreciation. <carMake>VW</carMake> sold just 3354 Phaetons in America during three model years before it mercifully stopped sending them here. But the Phaeton never left production in Europe, and a new one is due this year.
