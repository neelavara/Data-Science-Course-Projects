It’s how these cars behave in those corners where the two stand apart. The Corvette’s steering is wickedly quick and precise, and its grip is effectively endless. You would have to be a world-class thickhead to induce understeer. Once you’re acclimated to the car, you can still enter a corner at a speed you think is too fast, and the front end will respond the same as if you were crawling. Mid-corner, you can keep steering tighter and tighter until you drive yourself right off the inside of the turn. It simply won’t let go. That sort of over-engineering once was the provenance of Bavaria, but <carMake>Chevrolet</carMake> has shown America can create cars that stay glued to the corner.
