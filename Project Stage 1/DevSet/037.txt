Conspiracy theorists will tell you that <carMake>BMW’s</carMake> payroll got a little lighter when the current-generation 3-series appeared. Our early reviews were tempered with disappointment because the car wasn’t as involving as its predecessor, confusing those readers who believed our affinity for the 3 was based on monthly cash payoffs rather than the vehicle’s intrinsic goodness. And then the 335i lost a comparison test. To a <carMake>Lexus</carMake>. Even so, the collective merit of the full 3- and 4-series family landed it on our 10Best list. A 3-series in structure, but with additional chassis gusseting and tweaks to the suspension geometry, the 4-series contributes a substantial share of the model line’s desirability.
