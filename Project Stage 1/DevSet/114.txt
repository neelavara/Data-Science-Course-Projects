Our $25,035 <carMake>Chevrolet</carMake> Cruze LT is the newest in this class, and this generation hadn’t been tested before by this magazine. Now that <carMake>GM</carMake> is taking obesity seriously, the Cruze is 226 pounds lighter than its predecessor—and on par with the competition—in part due to a new engine that trades a hunk of iron for an aluminum block. The turbocharged 1.4-liter is just 2 cubic inches larger than last year’s four-cylinder, but with direct injection it now makes an additional 15 horsepower and 29 pound-feet of torque, for totals of 153 and 177, respectively.

We skipped the more expensive and ­torquier 1.5-liter turbo four-cylinder in the <carMake>Honda</carMake> Civic for the popular choice, a 158-hp naturally aspirated 2.0-liter. Our Civic EX trim is a stripper in this crowd—there’s no navigation, satellite radio, or power driver’s seat—but it does pack adaptive cruise control and a lane-keeping system that makes small steering inputs to keep the car centered in its lane. It’s also the cheapest entrant at $22,875.

The <carMake>Hyundai</carMake> Elantra, redesigned for 2017, has a striking new look that suggests the carmaker hasn’t backed off the throttle. Along with fresh designs inside and out and a retuned suspension, there’s a new 147-hp 2.0-liter engine named Nu, from the Greek alphabet. Our $23,310 Limited comes well equipped with satellite radio and heated leather seats, with floor mats its only option.

The <carMake>Mazda</carMake> 3 may seem dated in this crowd of newcomers, but it has earned its place here. As our reigning champ, the 3 has already knocked off five competitors in two prior tests. Our sedan is equipped with the smaller, 155-hp 2.0-liter engine for $24,430 in Grand Touring spec. It includes leatherette seats, blind-spot monitoring, and <carMake>­Mazda’s</carMake> user-friendly infotainment system with a large control knob between the seats, as in the best luxury-car systems.

Finally, the <carMake>Nissan</carMake> Sentra makes its first appearance in a Car and Driver comparison test since 2007. After it finished in last place nine years ago, we never felt compelled to invite the <carMake>Nissan</carMake> back. With a recent mid-cycle refresh and the momentum of 203,509 sales last year, the <carMake>Nissan</carMake> finally has a shot at redemption. The $25,545 SL trim uses the same 1.8-liter four-cylinder and continuously variable transmission as the rest of the Sentra line but comes with the ­longest list of equipment of any car in this test.
