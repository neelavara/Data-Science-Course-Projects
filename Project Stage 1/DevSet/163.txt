The Accord has moved past interesting and gone directly to sophisticated. It’s as if they took notes at an <carMake>Audi</carMake> design seminar. <carMake>Honda</carMake>’s simulated open-pore wood trim and brushed-metal accents seem borrowed from a higher class of car. The temperature controls use knobs backlit white until you turn them, at which point they turn blue or red, depending on the cold or hot direction of the dial. With the exception of trim pieces just below the door handles, the interior materials look and feel more premium than the Camry’s and indeed more premium than we’d expect from a midsize family sedan. It’s an impressive step for <carMake>Honda</carMake>.
