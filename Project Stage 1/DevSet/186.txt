With the crossover elbowing out the sedan as the vehicle of choice for the everyman, the smallest, most affordably priced premium utes now serve as the entrée to ­luxury-brand ownership. Simulta­neously, the perpetual upward ­trajectory of vehicle sizes and prices has left a gaping hole for a class of tiny crossovers below the <carMake>Audi</carMake> Q5, the <carMake>BMW</carMake> X3, and the <carMake>Lexus</carMake> RX. These smallest crossovers start around $36,000, with all-wheel drive optional if not standard and a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-four the consensus powertrain.
<carMake>BMW</carMake> launched this burgeoning segment in the U.S. in 2013 with the X1, then completely rethought its approach three short years later. You might expect <carMake>Audi</carMake>, no stranger to selling small premium cars in the U.S., to have an advantage in this particular game.The <carMake>Lexus</carMake> NX200t checks in almost 10 inches longer than the <carMake>Audi</carMake> and 500 pounds heavier than <carMake>Mercedes’</carMake> entrant, although the envelope doesn’t feel significantly larger from the inside. While the NX is only <carMake>Lexus’s</carMake> second unibody crossover, the brand is working from deep experience.
