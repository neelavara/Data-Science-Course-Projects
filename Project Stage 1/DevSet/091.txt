That same phenomenon is just beginning to play out in our beloved hot-hatch segment, a first step on the factory-hot-rod ladder onto which go-fast technology slowly but surely trickles. With the spiciest hatchbacks making roughly 300 horsepower, the major players have turned to all-wheel drive to provide some relief to the front tires. In our May 2016 issue, the <carMake>Ford</carMake> Focus RS claimed the belt by defeating the <carMake>Volkswagen</carMake> Golf R and the <carMake>Subaru</carMake> WRX STI (okay, the <carMake>Subaru</carMake> isn’t a hatch, but it should be one). <carMake>Honda</carMake>, however, still sees merit in the original front-wheel-drive formula.
