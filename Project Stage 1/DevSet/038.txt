And, owing to its longer life span, you have probably heard even more about <carMake>Volkswagen’s</carMake> genre-defining hot hatch, the GTI. It’s now in its seventh generation.

While the hatchback version is no longer available, say “WRX” and the image that probably pops into mind is the notchback version anyway.
