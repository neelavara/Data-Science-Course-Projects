 While the Accord Plug-In hybrid is the first application of <carMake>Honda’s</carMake> new two-motor system, it will also appear in an Accord hybrid equipped with a smaller-capacity lithium-ion battery.

<carMake>Honda</carMake> has fitted a slightly smaller battery than has Ford, rated at 6.7 kWh, and this produces roughly a third less rated electric range—only 13 miles. But just as the conventional Accord is about 200 pounds lighter than the equivalent Fusion, so is the PHEV version. That results in 115-MPGe and 46-mpg EPA-combined ratings, both of which beat the Fusion’s numbers.
