In this competition, we’ve included the <carMake>Chevrolet</carMake> Malibu and the <carMake>Toyota</carMake> Camry because they’re brand-new. We felt compelled to include a five-cylinder <carMake>Volkswagen</carMake> because the Passat has already won a comparo in V-6 guise [October 2011]. The <carMake>Hyundai</carMake> Sonata was included for its victory in our “Practically Chic” shootout [May 2010]. Since 2007, we’ve failed to include its sister ship, the <carMake>Kia</carMake> Optima, in any ménage à six-pack, so why not now? And the <carMake>Honda</carMake> Accord tagged along like the little brother that it is, this time by dint of its 10Best laurels. Notice, however, that the Accord is long in the tooth, with the ninth generation slated to roll out this fall.
