We last compared hi-po SUVs in January 2010. Back then, we included a Range Rover Sport Supercharged, but it finished last. So this time around, we ditched the Brit in favor of the new 550-hp <carMake>Mercedes-Benz</carMake> ML63, the first of these bruisers to wear an <carMake>AMG</carMake> badge since the third-gen MLs were launched in 2011.

Returning to the fray is the <carMake>Jeep</carMake> Grand Cherokee SRT8, which finished third in 2010. Since then, the <carMake>Jeep</carMake> has benefited from a full redesign including a revised rear suspension, a stiffer body structure, 50 bonus horses, paddle shifters, an improved ride, and a pair of hood-mounted heat extractors that look like dinosaur nostrils. What’s more, the Jeep’s old center-mounted exhausts have been ditched in favor of conventional left/right exits, and a Class IV hitch is now a factory option.

The <carMake>Porsche</carMake> Cayenne Turbo returns, too, hoping to improve on its previous runner-up finish. But this is the second-gen Cayenne, with a body that looks less air-puffed from every angle. It rides on 1.6 inches of newfound wheelbase, includes a wholly new cockpit that in several ways mimics the Panamera’s, and makes use of a revised all-wheel-drive system connected to an eight-speed Tiptronic automatic. Cargo room is up and weight is down. Our test car proved 63 pounds lighter than the Turbo S we tested in 2010.

<carMake>BMW’s</carMake> X5 M likewise returns, hoping to retain its champion status. It affords us a chance to sample the latest iterations of <carMake>BMW’s</carMake> iDrive, full-time all-wheel-drive system, and limited-slip torque-vectoring rear differential. You believe that? Ha-ha. All we really wanted was to mess around again with 555 horsepower, obtaining 60 mph in 4.0 seconds. That’s quicker than an <carMake>Aston Martin</carMake> V-12 Vantage. From a 5289-pound SUV with $100 “high-gloss roof rails”—proof that <carMake>BMW</carMake> is amused by all of this, too.
