It’s rotten what we’re doing, and we admit it. Totally rotten and unfair and, well, maybe just a little bit un-American. We’re taking the most enthralling new sports car in a generation—my God, it’s actually affordable!—and throwing it under the galloping hooves of a semi-exotic thoroughbred that most of us here couldn’t afford even if we never move out of our parents’ basements.

(See, we’re saving you the trouble of writing this stuff in letters.)

By whatever strange forces create unlikely allies, <carMake>Toyota</carMake> and <carMake>Subaru</carMake> got together and gave our kind a gift: a rear-drive sports coupe with a 2700ish-pound curb weight and the reflexes of a kit fox. It has exactly enough seats and trunk space to make it halfway practical, and they didn’t even louse up the styling. We should be sending love letters and boxes of chocolates to Japan for the $25,092 <carMake>Scion</carMake> FR-S (and its sister car, the <carMake>Subaru</carMake> BRZ) instead of throwing it against a $76,560 <carMake>Porsche</carMake> Cayman S. Yes, we are ungrateful wretches, and we know it.
