Our tested <carMake>Nissan</carMake> Rogue Sport SL AWD is new to the States but has been a known quantity overseas for years. Called Qashqai (CASH-kye) in Europe, where it’s one of <carMake>Nissan</carMake>’s best-sellers, the Rogue Sport slots between the smaller Juke and larger Rogue in the automaker’s U.S. lineup. It marries the styling, interior bits, and practicality of the larger (and <carMake>Nissan</carMake>’s best-selling) Rogue with more city-friendly dimensions, measuring just over a foot shorter than its big brother.
Its sportier little brother gets a 188-hp turbocharged I-4, and its big brother gets a 170-hp four-cylinder, but the Rogue Sport inexplicably gets saddled with a 2.0-liter I-4 that makes a mere 141 hp and 147 lb-ft of torque—the lowest horsepower in our test. The Rogue Sport sends its power through a standard CVT to an optional all-wheel-drive system. Our Rogue Sport SL AWD tester comes pretty well equipped at its $28,380 base price, which has 7.4 inches of ground clearance and features such as <carMake>Nissan</carMake>’s Around View 360-degree camera system and a driver-selectable all-wheel-drive lock switch. With the addition of a handful of option packages containing radar cruise control, lane departure warning, and a slew of other active safety tech, our Rogue Sport stickered for $31,625.
