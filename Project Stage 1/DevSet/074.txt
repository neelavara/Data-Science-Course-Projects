Forgive this observation, but most modern compact SUVs have all the personality of an escalator. And they’re all pretty much the same escalator, as the genre has recently coalesced around a single approach. After years of experimentation that brought us everything from the <carMake>Suzuki</carMake> X-90 to the <carMake>Isuzu</carMake> Amigo, items such as transfer cases, V-6 engines, softtops, and three-door models are all as out as, well, <carMake>Suzuki</carMake> and <carMake>Isuzu</carMake>. Gone, also, is any semblance of truckishness. Even with their optional all-wheel-drive systems, these jacked-up unibody wagons now make no pretense of any real off-road ability.

But for all the conformity, the car industry is clearly giving buyers what they want. Small crossovers are now one of the market’s fastest-growing segments. Only <carMake>Mazda</carMake> seems intent on subverting the compact-crossover template by building one that’s actually fun to drive. We singled out the then-new CX-5 in a six-model comparison test last year [“The Minors,” September 2012], proclaiming it enthusiast-primed despite a 155-hp 2.0-liter four-cylinder that left it last in acceleration tests. Our esteem for the 2013 CX-5 came from its handling, but for the 2014 model year a new 2.5-liter four-cylinder making 184 horsepower comes standard in all but the base trim.
