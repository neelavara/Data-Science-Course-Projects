Dipped in Racing Yellow, our <carMake>Porsche</carMake> 911 Turbo S looks like the world’s largest Lemonhead. At $195,175, it is nearly double the cost of the Corvette. A 560-hp treat from the continent that brought us marzipan, it comes with a twin-turbocharged 3.8-liter flat-six, four-wheel drive, four-wheel steering, and a dual-clutch seven-speed automatic, all of which makes it one of the quickest cars we’ve ever tested.

The vanilla-white car in our confectionery is the <carMake>Nissan</carMake> GT-R NISMO. <carMake>Nissan’s</carMake> performance department adds an extra 55 horsepower to the GT-R’s 3.8-liter V-6 by borrowing the turbochargers from the GT-R GT3 racer. A revised chassis, complete with NISMO-spec Dunlop SP Sport Maxx GT run-flats and half-inch-wider front wheels, improves the grip. A unibody laced with structural adhesives improves the rigidity. This GT-R has an aero package, including a large carbon-fiber wing that creates downforce without—according to <carMake>Nissan</carMake>—affecting the drag coefficient. If this small-batch GT-R sounds appealing, then the $151,880 price, a 50-percent hike over a regular GT-R, might not have you doing a spit-take.
