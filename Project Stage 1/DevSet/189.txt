<carMake>Ford</carMake> insisted on entering this contest with its optional turbo V-6 ($1095), which the company?views as an alternative to conventional V-8s. We asked for a truck with the company’s most popular engine and, according to Ford, the EcoBoost V-6 slightly outsells the 5.0-liter V-8 available in the F-150. ?And, indeed, the turbo V-6 makes V-8 horsepower—10 horses up on <carMake>Chevy’s</carMake> 5.3 and not much less powerful than <carMake>Ram’s</carMake> 5.7-liter Hemi. By now you should know that this EcoBoost prioritizes Boost over Eco. The EPA rates the <carMake>Ford’s</carMake> fuel economy even with the <carMake>Ram’s</carMake> and slightly worse than the <carMake>Chevy’s</carMake>. That all three of our trucks averaged 13 mpg over 500 miles of mixed terrain indicates two things: We used full throttle more frequently than was strictly necessary, and the EcoBoost V-6 is like a V-8 in essentially every respect, except it doesn’t sound as good. Despite its optional engine, our Lariat-level 4x4 SuperCrew F-150 was the cheapest truck in the test at a not-at-all cheap $49,725.

The <carMake>Ram</carMake> 1500 is our reigning full-size pickup champ. And the <carMake>Ram</carMake> folk loaded up a brown-and-tan <carMake>Ram</carMake> 1500 Laramie Longhorn Edition Crew Cab to the tune of $55,390, including the Hemi V-8, optional air springs ($1595), and enough cowboy filigree that even the “cowboy” from the Village People might consider it a bit flamboyant.

The updated version of the Texas-built <carMake>Toyota</carMake> Tundra was not available in time for this comparison.
