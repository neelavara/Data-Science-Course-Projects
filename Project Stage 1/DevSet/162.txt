Rounding out our trio of tweeners is the redesigned second-generation <carMake>Subaru</carMake> Crosstrek Limited. Although it’s easy to dismiss the Crosstrek as a lifted Impreza hatch (with which the Crosstrek shares its new chassis and powertrain), a lot of engineering work goes into differentiating the two models. The most obvious difference is the Crosstrek’s suspension lift, which gives the crossover an impressive test-best 8.7 inches of ground clearance,  and Stablex dampers designed to allow the <carMake>Subaru</carMake> to absorb hits from punishing conditions both on- and off-road. The Crosstrek’s power comes from a 2.0-liter flat-four pushing out 152 hp and a comparison-low 145 lb-ft of torque. A six-speed manual is standard on the Crosstrek, but our tester puts its power to its torque-vectoring all-wheel drive-system through a CVT. The Crosstrek comes standard with <carMake>Subaru</carMake>’s X-Mode off-road assist system and the automaker’s new Apple CarPlay and Android Auto–friendly infotainment suite for $27,210. Our tester was loaded up with <carMake>Subaru</carMake>’s EyeSight active-safety package, a moonroof, and a premium audio system for an out-the-door price of $30,655.
