We have no <carMake>Chrysler</carMake>/<carMake>Dodge</carMake> or <carMake>Nissan</carMake> entrants here because neither one has been sufficiently updated since last losing a comparison test. Meanwhile, our reigning champ in the segment, the <carMake>Honda</carMake> Odyssey, which won every minivan comparo we’ve conducted in the last decade, was refreshed for 2014.

<carMake>Toyota’s</carMake> Sienna is also fresh off a fluffing, with a stiffened structure, updated dashboard, new grille and headlights, and the “Driver Easy Speak” built-in bullhorn. The latter uses the voice-control microphone already embedded above the driver’s head and broadcasts scoldings through the rear speakers. The <carMake>Toyota</carMake> is a “Top Safety Pick Plus” on account of its available Pre-Collision automatic-braking system.

The <carMake>Kia</carMake> Sedona is all-new this year. Joining the Odyssey on Safety Pick Tier Two (because its collision-warning system only screams of impending doom, rather than braking to do something about it), it also boasts eight different electronic systems to mitigate the loss of traction or stability. All this for an eminently controllable transportation appliance. Our SXL also packs 19-inch wheels, matches the <carMake>Toyota’s</carMake> sunroof count, and includes a $2700 tech package that adds lane-departure and forward-collision warnings, adaptive cruise, and a surround-view system. Yet at $43,295, it’s the cheapest in this test.

Our <carMake>Kia</carMake> is, however, missing one $995 option that could make all the difference: a back-seat entertainment system.
