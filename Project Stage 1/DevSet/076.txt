Eight candidates met our initial criteria, though we decided that <carMake>Lincoln’s</carMake> new ­Continental is more of a luxury car than a sports sedan. The Genesis G80 Sport, a G80 with the larger G90’s 365-hp twin-turbocharged V-6, would likely have played well here, but it doesn’t go on sale for a few more months. Of the six that remained, there are only five in this test: We asked for a <carMake>Maserati</carMake> Ghibli at the eleventh hour, and the only one available (a loaded S Q4 touching $100,000) was deemed too expensive.

Of the five competitors, one of the newest is the 396-hp ­<carMake>Mercedes-AMG</carMake> E43 4MATIC. Based on the new E-class, the E43 occupies the divide between the 241-hp turbocharged four-cylinder of the E300 and the 603-hp twin-turbocharged V-8 in the E63 S. At the other end of the price scale is the <carMake>Audi</carMake> A6 3.0T Quattro. Undefeated in its previous two comparison tests, the A6 underwent a mid-cycle refresh for 2016 that brought new front and rear fascias, Apple CarPlay compatibility, and in-car Wi-Fi.
