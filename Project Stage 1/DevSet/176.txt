We’re not implying that the <carMake>BMW</carMake> X6 M and the <carMake>Mercedes-AMG</carMake> GLE63 S Coupe are in any way like those two towers. For one, both vehicles were, in our testing, watertight and structurally sound. To see the towers as an allegory for these two hot-rodded coupe-ish SUV thingamabobs would be to imply that German carmakers are in a constant and sometimes futile measuring contest, caring only about one-upping each other. And that can’t be true because, um, these two vehicles are both made in the United States.

<carMake>Mercedes</carMake> started this whole “four-door coupe” silliness with its CLS sedan, and was followed quickly by <carMake>BMW</carMake> and its two four-door coupes. <carMake>BMW</carMake> was the first to take the basic concept to new heights of absurdity with its X6. And it was <carMake>Mercedes</carMake> that fired back with the large bar of soap known as the GLE Coupe. And look at where this has gotten us: Testing 5200-plus-pound perform­ance vehicles that ride on massive, sticky summer tires and provide precious little of the utility of an SUV with precious little of the fun of a proper performance car. It’s a cautionary tale.
