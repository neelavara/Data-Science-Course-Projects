Another, perhaps more useful way of coping with high gas prices is to consider replacing your current pump-addicted ride with something smaller and more fuel efficient. As recently as our May 2011 issue, we scrutinized five compact four-doors [“Startup Sedans”]. In that comparison test, <carMake>Ford’s</carMake> new Focus, in SEL trim, emerged victorious over the previous champion, the <carMake>Mazda</carMake> 3. It also dispatched the newbies: <carMake>Hyundai</carMake> Elantra, <carMake>Chevy</carMake> Cruze, and <carMake>Volkswagen</carMake> Jetta. <carMake>Ford</carMake> snatched the small-car trophy from the sporty <carMake>Mazda</carMake> 3 by delivering more refinement, style, and value than the grinning <carMake>Mazda</carMake>, while nearly matching the 3’s handling and performance.
