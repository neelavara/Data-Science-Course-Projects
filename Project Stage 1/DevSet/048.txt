With a price target of $25,000, we invited three cars to compete. The <carMake>Mini</carMake> Cooper S is freshly redone and the newest of the bunch. It might look like the same old <carMake>Mini</carMake>, but it’s larger and more powerful than before. Making the heat is a 189-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four designed by <carMake>Mini’s</carMake> parent company, <carMake>BMW</carMake>.

For its initial comparison-test appearance, we chose the <carMake>Ford</carMake> Fiesta in the ST guise that wowed every one of us last year and won itself a place on our 10Best list. The third entry is the weaponized <carMake>Fiat</carMake> 500, the <carMake>Abarth</carMake> edition. A hellion of a car with an unmuffled 1.4-liter turbo four, the <carMake>Abarth</carMake> made the cut despite losing a comparison test a couple of years ago because it’s still a sub-$30,000 car we can get excited about, and it also competes directly with this set.
