When it comes to trucks, the engine inspires as much loyalty as the vehicle it powers. <carMake>Mazda’s</carMake> Skyactiv or <carMake>Hyundai’s</carMake> Tau engines will never haul in the licensing profits of the Power Stroke, Duramax, or Cummins names. And in light-duty trucks, the displacement also becomes the brand. A Ram isn’t just powered by a Hemi, it’s a “Five-Seven.” A Silverado destined to earn its living better have the “Six-Two.” And if you were serious about building an F-series for work, it used to be that you ordered the old “Five-Four.”

So <carMake>Ford</carMake> positioning its puny 3.5-liter twin-turbo EcoBoost V-6 atop the F-series lineup caused more than a few observers to choke on their chew. To see how the power structure shakes out, we lined up two nearly identical F-150s: one with the 5.0-liter V-8, one with the 3.5-liter twin-turbo EcoBoost V-6. Both are four-wheel-drive crew cabs with 5.5-foot beds. They pack the same six-speed automatic and 3.55:1 final-drive ratio. Aside from the turbocharged truck’s option to display a digital boost gauge, the interiors are indistinguishable. Even the paints are similar shades, just in case UV saturation affects weight. The EcoBoost F-150 did, however, come in 213 pounds heavier, in part due to its dual-pane sunroof and the FX4 package’s skidplates.
