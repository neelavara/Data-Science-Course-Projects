It’s been nearly a year since AutoGuide.com chose the <carMake>Kia</carMake> Sorento as the top pick in a highly competitive 
mid-sized crossover contest. The <carMake>Kia</carMake> Sorento, on the other hand, ran home with the big trophy despite its 
even smaller cargo capacity. Shrug. Auto journalists are a funny breed.
With GM having unleashed a bigger Acadia this year, cleverly disguised with <carMake>Chevrolet</carMake> Traverse badging, 
it seems only right we let the General take another swing at the Korean champ, so that’s just what we’ve done.
