The home team is represented in part by the <carMake>Chevrolet</carMake> Impala, which qualifies for big-car status now that it rides on <carMake>GM’s</carMake> stretched Epsilon platform along with the <carMake>Buick</carMake> LaCrosse and <carMake>Cadillac</carMake> XTS. The two oddities here are also from Detroit. The <carMake>Chrysler</carMake> 300S and <carMake>Dodge</carMake> Charger SXT are both rear-drive, and neither one is derived from a smaller model.

In fact, present-day <carMake>Chrysler</carMake> has no credible seat at the mid-size-sedan feast, having left a hole between the <carMake>Dodge</carMake> Avenger and the <carMake>Dodge</carMake> Charger (and between the <carMake>Chrysler</carMake> 200 and 300) big enough to drive a quarter-million <carMake>Honda</carMake> Accords through. While <carMake>Chrysler</carMake> is attending to that problem, it is trying to squeeze the last drops of market mileage from the Charger and 300 by adding a new eight-speed automatic to the 3.6-liter V-6 spec sheet that promises better fuel economy. Conspicuous by its absence is the face-lifted Ford Taurus, mainly because the folks in Dearborn couldn’t find us one with a V-6 to test.
