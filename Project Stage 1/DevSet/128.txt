It's an on-the-nose, obvious, literal, and okay, shallow idea: Pit the transmogrified <carMake>Toyota</carMake> Tacoma against the fresh-enough <carMake>Chevrolet</carMake> Colorado during a journey from Tacoma to Colorado. Get it?

After <carMake>Ford</carMake> dumped the Ranger in 2011 and Dodge/Ram bumped off the Dakota, and then when <carMake>GM</carMake> pulled the original <carMake>Chevrolet</carMake> Colorado and <carMake>GMC</carMake> Canyon after 2012, the mid-size truck segment was effectively ceded to <carMake>Toyota</carMake>. Sure, the <carMake>­Nissan</carMake> Frontier and the odd <carMake>Honda</carMake> Ridgeline were around to pick up the scraps and the eccentrics, but it was surely the Taco’s time. Toyota had every right to grow complacent as it sold 155,041 Tacomas last year. That’s despite the truck having last been redesigned back in 2005.
