The old one is Magic Wagon No. 1, the actual preproduction 1984 Ply­mouth Voyager that <carMake>Chrysler’s</carMake> then CEO, Lee Iacocca, used at press unveilings, dealer meetings, and general cheerleading sessions to drum up enthusiasm for the new “T115” minivans. Stray badges shoved into a rear cubby indicate that it sometimes also appeared as a <carMake>Dodge</carMake> Caravan. There are about 12,000 miles on the clock, and fake wood forests the sides. A lot of corduroy cows died to upholster those seats.

The front-drive minivan was a Hail Mary pass thrown up by a team ready to be shoved out of the league. The K-car’s success had given <carMake>Chrysler</carMake> just enough freedom to take a big chance on re­inven­ting family transportation. If it worked, the company would pay off its government-guaranteed loans and proceed onward to prosperity under Iacocca’s enlightened whip. If the mini­van turned out to be a sales turd, well, <carMake>Chrysler</carMake> was going bankrupt anyhow. The company couldn’t afford the extra paper to write down a Plan B.

Is this a specious comparison? Is it polluted with nostalgia, addled with spurious allusions, and basically absurd? Damn straight. But we couldn’t find a first-gen <carMake>Porsche</carMake> 911 with which to do that car-magazine cliché thing, comparing the old one against the new one, so we figured this would be just as good. Plus, driving these two back to back proved oddly enlightening, even though we couldn’t take the oldster past 45 mph on a loop at <carMake>Chrysler’s</carMake> Chelsea, Michigan, proving grounds. Of course the new van is better. It’s also worse. So?
