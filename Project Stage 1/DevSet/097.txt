And because most of this country doesn’t have the cash (or credit) to easily part with six-figure sums, we set a rough $100,000 price cap on our luxury sedans, with each luxobarge sporting six-cylinders (or fewer) and all-wheel drive.

With views of the Pacific Ocean and Catalina Island looming offshore, the average home value is $1.9 million, according to Zillow. From there, we would journey to Malibu, where the Hollywood elite sun and splash. Would any car not bearing a three-pointed star turn the heads of the landed and beached gentry?
