Yet despite the apparent similarities, these two <carMake>BMW</carMake> are the products of different compromises. Everyone knows what an M car is. You expect the M6 Gran Coupe to pummel any racetrack, dominate any back road, and obliterate everything on the autobahn. But what’s an Alpina B6? For starters, here’s what it’s not: a tuner car. At least no more so than the M6.
Alpina is no fly-by-night organization, having celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2015—a milestone M won’t hit until 2022. We’ll forgive you if you’ve never heard of Alpina. After all, the company prides itself on exclusivity, and that means not selling tens of thousands of cars every year. But you need to pay attention from here on out because (spoiler alert) the Alpina B6 is a better car than the M6. But it took us testing them head to head to figure this out.
