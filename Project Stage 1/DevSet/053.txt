In steady state cornering, the Corvette sets a new production car record of 1.18 average g. The <carMake>Porsche</carMake> manages a quality runner-up 1.05. The <carMake>Porsche</carMake>’s advantage slips on the figure eight, though, where the manually shifted Corvette still manages to dominate. The 911’s 23.1-second lap at 0.91 average g is supercar quick, but the Corvette posts a nearly record-breaking number. Its 22.3-second lap at 0.96 average g ties it with the Corvette Z06 and Viper ACR for second behind the mighty <carMake>Porsche</carMake> 918. Test guru Kim Reynolds is convinced an automatic Corvette could post an even better lap time with quicker upshifts. That’s a double-edged sword, though, because as quick as the automatic Corvette is at upshifting, its downshifting is ponderous and glacial.
