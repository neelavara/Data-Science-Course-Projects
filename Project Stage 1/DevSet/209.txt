I’ve been covering electric cars for so long that I once pushed a stone-dead <carMake>General Motors</carMake> EV1 down a street. There have been plenty of “firsts” in this rapidly evolving segment. But this exclusive comparison—the Model 3, the second-gen Leaf, and the Bolt—matters because it’s a milestone. This is the first time anyone has tested and compared three electric vehicles that really could be your affordable, everyday, one-and-only car. With ranges of 150 to 310 miles and stripper-version base prices from $37,495 to $36,000 before federal and local incentives, they’re full-fledged, meat-of-the-market automobiles. And <carMake>Tesla</carMake>’s global Supercharger network is 7,320 (and counting) nails in the coffin of the argument that an EV can’t replace your gas-gulping jalopy as your road trip car of choice.
To help with evaluating our exclusive gathering, we brought in some veteran co-conspirators of all things electric. Patrick Hong has a 23-career testing cars (including that same <carMake>GM</carMake> EV1) and carries degrees in both mechanical and aerospace engineering. Alec Brooks is a seminal figure in the history of the modern electric car, having led the development of the <carMake>GM</carMake> Impact, predecessor of the EV1, and run the development of the of the tzero electric sports car, which was the inspiration for <carMake>Tesla</carMake>’s Roadster.
