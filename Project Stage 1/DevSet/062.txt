Three’s a trend, but something short of a comeback. Even with enough wagons clustered in one segment to warrant our first roundup in 13 years, the two-box car remains endangered. The taller, truckier version of the wagon, the compact crossover, now dominates the market for utility vehicles. Case in point: <carMake>Audi</carMake> sells nine Q5s for every Allroad it unloads.

You can have your pick of a dozen crossovers for similar money, but there are just three bona fide wagons in the compact-luxury class. Each one hails from Europe, where sensible people buy these pragmatic cars en masse. Even if you’ve never bought one or even seen one, you know their siblings well. The <carMake>BMW</carMake> 328i xDrive sports wagon is the cargo-toting variant of the 23-time 10Best-winning sedan. <carMake>Audi’s</carMake> Allroad is a sort of <carMake>Subaru</carMake> Outback of luxury cars, with a 1.5-inch suspension lift compared with the Euro-only A4 Avant on which it’s based. The <carMake>Volvo</carMake> V60, derived from the S60 sedan, is the newcomer here, though it’s been sold overseas since 2011. Consider it a stopgap to keep showroom floors fresh as <carMake>Volvo’s</carMake> new owner, Chinese automaker <carMake>Geely</carMake>, takes its sweet time preparing a full-lineup reboot.
