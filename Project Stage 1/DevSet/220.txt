The Shelby remains a mystery to me, and here’s why: The GT350 is a Mustang with a brilliant engine. The GT350R—which ostensibly only adds a bit of aero, carbon-fiber wheels, and R compound tires, removes the back seat, and slightly reworks the suspension—is as good to drive as a <carMake>Porsche</carMake> GT3. It is a pure and totally wonderful driver’s car. In fact, last year at our 2016 Best Driver’s Car, a Shelby R finished in second place behind the winning McLaren 570S. More impressively, we judged the GT350R better to drive than the <carMake>Porsche</carMake> 911 Carrera S, Camaro SS 1LE, <carMake>Dodge</carMake> Viper ACR, AMG GT S, <carMake>Audi</carMake> R8 V10 Plus, and <carMake>Acura</carMake> NSX, among others. Those are serious cars, some of which are outright supercars, yet our judges determined the bright yellow Mustang with the loud exhaust superior. It’s that great.
