<carMake>Aston Martin</carMake> refers to its new Rapide as the “only four-door sports car in the world.” <carMake>Porsche</carMake> refers to its Panamera as the company’s “first sports car for four.” When two manufacturers so coincidentally match boasts, our response is: “comparison test.”

And, in truth, these two front-engine supersedans are similar in dimensions and weight. The differences? Well, the Rapide’s naturally aspirated V-12 transmits its 470 horses through a carbon-fiber driveshaft to the rear wheels, whereas the Panamera’s twin-turbo V-8 doles out its 500 to all four. Of course, you’ve got to disregard that walloping variance in base price—a guy like Schnitta would, and he’s pretty much <carMake>Aston’s</carMake> and <carMake>Porsche’s</carMake> target buyer, familiar with “Fast Eddie’s” observation: “Rich can be arranged. Rich can come fairly easily. ”
