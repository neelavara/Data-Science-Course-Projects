The <carMake>Volkswagen</carMake> Beetle Turbo and the <carMake>Mini</carMake> Cooper S convertibles are built for the fashionable, for people who know they look great in linen pants and that denim makes their butts seem huge. They can tell a genuine Barcelona chair from a knockoff at 60 yards. Style counts. So does cute. Performance? Utility? Not really.

But must fashionistas suffer to be chic? Both the Mexican-made <carMake>Beetle</carMake> and the Brit-built <carMake>Mini</carMake> convertibles are compromised by their self-conscious designs. They’ve got tiny, nearly useless trunks. Big, fluffy-white Samoyeds may look stunning sitting in the open air on either of the cars’ rear seats, but human beings will be cramped.
