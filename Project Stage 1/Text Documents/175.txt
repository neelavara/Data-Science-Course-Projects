A diesel’s key selling point is its efficiency. In this test we have fuel tanks sized from 22.5 to 27.7 gallons and EPA-combined fuel-economy ratings in the low- to mid-20s. Thus, even the <carMake>BMW</carMake> X5 xDrive35d, with both the most convoluted name and the smallest tank, should be capable of easily leaping from New York to Cleveland without a fill-up. And if you’re very easy on the <carMake>Mercedes-Benz</carMake> ML350 BlueTec, which has the largest tank, you might just squeak it all the way to Chicago.
