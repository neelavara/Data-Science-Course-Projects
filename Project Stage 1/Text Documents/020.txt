Let’s take a look at the challengers.
From Germany is the S-Class’ archrival, the <carMake>BMW</carMake> 7 Series. Representing Bavaria’s best is the 2018 <carMake>BMW</carMake> 740e xDrive iPerformance. Powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged I-4 paired with an electric motor, the 740e is an admittedly odd choice for this test, given the rest of our competitors are powered by twin-turbo V-6s. But considering the segment is moving toward increased electrification (and that no I-6-powered 740i models were available for testing), it was the right choice. Plus 14 miles of EV range in a 4,700-pound limo is just plain cool. Our very lightly optioned 740e tester sneaks right in under our price cap, stickering for $99,845.
