Driving a new <carMake>Acura</carMake> NSX in 2005 was a bit like trying to text on a Motorola StarTAC. Yes, that was the best mobile phone of the 1990s, but it was hardly the best tool for the job. And yes, <carMake>Acura</carMake> had updated the NSX over its life, but by 2005 this aluminum supercar was past its sell-by date. Its V-6 still sounded as good as it did when it arrived in 1990; it was just that the 290-hp NSX couldn’t compete in a streetscape filled with 400-hp Corvettes, 911 Turbos, and AMGs. And certainly not with its $90,000 sticker.

This pristine 2005 open-top NSX-T has logged only 40,000 miles in the past nine years, while its value has traveled in reverse. Depreciation, that great economic equalizer, has dropped the going price for an ’05 NSX to less than $60,000. That about matches the price of a new, 265-hp <carMake>Porsche</carMake> Boxster with a few options—and they all have a few options. And that got us thinking: Which mid-engine car would we rather own and drive?
