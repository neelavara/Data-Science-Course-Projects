What does matter is what Jethro Bovingdon refers to as “cowboy science.” Roughly speaking, cowboy science means noise, burnouts, and nonoptimized drag racing. As far as which car’s V-8 barks better, the win goes to the Mustang. Both ponies have two-mode exhausts and eight pistons churning away on a crankshaft, but the higher-revving Ford makes much sweeter music. This is a notable improvement over the previous Mustang, which—let’s be frank—didn’t sound so hot. The Camaro’s exhaust note isn’t bad, but it’s not noteworthy (pun intended). The part that upsets me is that in some more than tangential way, the Chevy’s LT1 is related to the V-8 in the C7.R Corvettes. I’ve heard them run at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, and they are the best-sounding machines at the race. Imagine if rolling thunder got angry. So, Chevy tuners, a little more like that, please.
