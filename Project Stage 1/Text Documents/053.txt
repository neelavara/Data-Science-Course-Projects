If you want absolute performance at this price point and fuel economy, look no further than the <carMake>Audi</carMake>. A sleeper, the conservatively styled A4 is the quickest both in a straight line and around our figure-eight test. Its dual-clutch transmission and all-wheel drive give it a performance and traction edge off the line. But beyond 60 mph the Alfa’s best weight-to-power ratio and shortest gearing deliver the best performance, reaching 100 mph 1 second quicker and finishing the quarter-mile 3.3 mph faster than the <carMake>Audi</carMake>. Likewise, the <carMake>Mercedes</carMake>, with its Sport package, equals the <carMake>Audi</carMake>’s best-in-class figure-eight performance while stopping shorter. The Alfa’s figure-eight performance was severely handicapped by its overly aggressive stability control, which couldn’t be defeated.
