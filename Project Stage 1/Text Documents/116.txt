And every <carMake>Chevrolet</carMake> Colorado, Sherman’s handwritten notes attest, exceeds the length of the shortest Silverado. What does it all mean, other than that we need to arrange a remote office for Sherman? We don’t know. What we do know is that two vehicles from opposite edges of the automotive world can meet in the ­maybe-you-don’t-actually-need-a-pickup middle ground of “mid-size pickup truck.” And so it is with the Colorado and the Ridgeline. The <carMake>Chevy</carMake> hails from the world of Silverados, country songs, diesel, and brodozers. The <carMake>Honda</carMake> shares a platform with a minivan. Like an actual pickup, the <carMake>Chevy</carMake> is available in two bed lengths, two cab sizes, and with a choice of three engines (one of which burns that fuel you get at truck stops). The <carMake>Honda</carMake> is front-wheel drive in its base form and can turn the sides of its bed into an enormous speaker.
