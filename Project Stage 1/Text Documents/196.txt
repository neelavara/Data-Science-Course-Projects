There are sports sedans, and then there are sports sedans. Strictly defined, only a select few cars—the <carMake>BMW</carMake> M5, the <carMake>Porsche</carMake> Panamera, the <carMake>Cadillac</carMake> CTS-V—deserve the italics. They deliver exalted levels of grip, power, structural rigidity, and responsiveness, all in family-friendly packages. But most sports sedans are less tightly focused; they may have evolved from luxury cars, adding performance for the sake of competitiveness or car magazines such as this one. This is what we’re dealing with here.

Competing in the tough $50,000-to-$60,000 bracket, neither the <carMake>Audi</carMake> A6 nor the <carMake>Lexus</carMake> GS350 is a track monster like the M5.
