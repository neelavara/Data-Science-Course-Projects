As for the Mustang GT, well, it represents one more reason to buy Michelin stock. The <carMake>Ford</carMake> is content to just sit and roast ’em. I should mention that although both cars come with line lock (a feature that disables the rear brakes to allow for easier burnouts), I’m both impatient and not too bright. I couldn’t get line lock to work, and after two attempts I stopped trying.
