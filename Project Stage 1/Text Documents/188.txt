One is mass market and utilitarian, the other a concept car rolling into the real world. Ham-radio operators drive the Volt. Justin Bieber drives the Karma. But underneath, the idea is pretty much the same—they are, for lack of a better term, practical EVs. Technically, the <carMake>Chevrolet</carMake> Volt and the <carMake>Fisker</carMake> Karma are hybrids, using both batteries and gasoline to effect locomotion via electric motors. Both cars run purely on electricity from the power grid as long as the battery packs hold juice. When the battery range ends, a gasoline engine powers a generator, freeing the driver from the tyranny of charging times and limited EV infrastructure.
