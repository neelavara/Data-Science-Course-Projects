None costs less than 130 large with options, though the <carMake>BMW</carMake> M6 comes closest as our price leader, even with its optional, special-order $5000 “Frozen Silver” matte paint finish. The Bimmer has a number of -ests on its curriculum vitae. It is the longest, widest, tallest, and heaviest in the group. Its twin-turbo 4.4-liter is the smallest of three V-8s here, but makes the most horsepower in the test, at 560 (the <carMake>Benz</carMake> gets the torque medal, at 664 pound-feet).

The dash-S marks this XKR as <carMake>Jaguar’s</carMake> hottest number, with a 550-hp supercharged V-8 that blurs the scenery in this aluminum-bodied, British Racing Green (but, of course) sprinter. At $138,875, the XKR-S is complete with no options, though, as with the M6, the premium for the convertible version is $6300 over a coupe.

Optioned to the hilt with, among other things, a $9000 performance package that adds carbon-fiber bits and 27 horsepower, this $171,225 <carMake>Mercedes-Benz</carMake> SL63 AMG lands 10 grand shy of a <carMake>Bentley</carMake> Continental GT V-8 coupe. The two-seat SL with its 5.5-liter twin-turbo V-8 is our only dedicated roadster; no coupe is available. But it is also the only one with a retractable hardtop that turns it into a decent facsimile of a coupe.
