From <carMake>Ford</carMake> comes the Explorer. Once a sales-topping SUV and the darling of suburbia (until it became branded a rolling, ­flipping, tire-tread-shedding menace), the Explorer is new from the rubber up. The ­traditional body-on-frame structure is gone, swapped for a slightly lighter unibody platform that also underpins the Flex and whose roots can be traced to <carMake>Volvo</carMake>. A V-8 is absent from the order books; the most powerful engine is a 290-hp, 3.5-liter V-6. For the fuel conscious, a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder with 237 horsepower is on its way. All-wheel drive is an option on V-6 models; otherwise, the Explorer is a front-drive machine.
