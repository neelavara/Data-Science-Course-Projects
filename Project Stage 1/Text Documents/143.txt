The three premium coupes in contention here pit youthful cunning against confident maturity. The <carMake>Cadillac</carMake> ATS and <carMake>Lexus</carMake> RC350 F Sport are the class’s pop celebs; think Justins, as in Timberlake and Bieber. Hollywood legend Clint Eastwood—with 60 years of acting, directing, and scoring to his credit—is the <carMake>Audi</carMake> S5 analogue. Roots reaching back to 2007 didn’t inhibit <carMake>Audi’s</carMake> veteran sports coupe from busting <carMake>BMW’s</carMake> then-new 435i in our 2014 comparison test, so we took it and threw it against these fresh newcomers.
