In its best year, the CLS only pulled in about 14,000 U.S. sales, a fraction of the business rung up by the mainstay E-class on which it is based. Still, where one German brand goes sniffing for more volume, others instinctively follow. <carMake>Volkswagen</carMake> now has its Passat-based CC; <carMake>Audi</carMake> has launched four-door coupe-y versions of the A4 and A6 called the A5 Sportback (for Europe only) and the new A7; and latecomer <carMake>BMW</carMake> is arriving for the second act with its own car based on the Concept Gran Coupé showmobile of 2010.

<carMake>Audi’s</carMake> approach is perhaps the riskiest. Defying the notion that a hatchback equals death in this market, the luxurious A7 rolls four seats, five doors, and 25 cubic feet of cargo space into a slant-back fuselage reminiscent of a 1940s streamliner.
