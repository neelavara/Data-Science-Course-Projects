We’ve been doing this particular head-to-head challenge for 50 years, and you loyal readers have never felt compelled to tell us to stop. The occasion for this particular comparison test is <carMake>Ford</carMake>’s launch of the bigly refreshed 2018 Mustang. For the purposes of this story, we got our hands on the GT Performance Pack 1. Why not the recently announced P-Pack 2? Because <carMake>Ford</carMake> isn’t releasing it until May. Representing <carMake>Chevrolet</carMake>’s interests is the Camaro SS 1LE, unchanged since 2016. Both our tested cars came with a six-speed manual transmission, though the new Mustang is available with a 10-speed automatic.
Let’s first break down the carryover Camaro SS. The Chevy comes packing a stout 6.2-liter pushrod V-8 that pumps out 455 horsepower and 455 lb-ft of torque. 1LE is Camaro code for a track-oriented option pack. All 1LE Camaros come with a black hood, black mirrors, blacked-out other bits, and a manual transmission. The SS 1LE gets Magnetic Ride Control, GM’s trick eLSD rearend and five levels of Performance Traction Management (aka PTM), Brembo brakes, and sticky Goodyear Eagle F1 Supercar 3 tires. It also has a dual-mode exhaust and coolers for oil, the differential, and the transmission. Our car came with the optional Recaro seats and Performance Data Recorder, a nifty built-in camera system to help you work on your lap times. All in, this red Chevy will set you back $46,295, an $8,300 bump over the Camaro SS’ base price of $37,995.
