Despite the funneling of crossovers into ever-smaller buckets, narrowing the field for this test was actual work. Alphabetically, then: Alfa's Stelvio effectively straddled our field’s $55,000 base-price/350-hp requirement with a 280-hp, $42,990 starting model and a 505-hp, $77,000 Quadrifoglio. <carMake>BMW’s</carMake> X3 and X4 M40i had similar problems, the X3 lacking power and the appropriately priced and competitively powerful X4 M40i lacking a practical roofline. Infiniti’s QX70 is just too old, its last redesign coming almost a decade ago. <carMake>Jaguar’s</carMake> F-Pace was beaten in our visit to this segment in 2016, and <carMake>Volvo’s</carMake> hottest XC60 powers its rear axle with an electric motor.
