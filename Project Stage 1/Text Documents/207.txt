Missed naming opportunities aside, what we gathered here was nothing short of America’s most-anticipated sports coupes—fantasy performance cars for those with sensible fantasies. We say “anticipated” because two of these three cars, the <carMake>Audi</carMake> and the <carMake>BMW</carMake>, were not yet on sale at the time of the test. The <carMake>Audi</carMake> won’t go on sale in the U.S. until a few months after you read this. The <carMake>BMW</carMake> should be available in mid-May. When we called <carMake>BMW</carMake> for a tester, the only 1-series M in the country was the one that served as the pace car for the Rolex 24 at Daytona. We stripped off the light bar, peeled back the stickers, and were on our way.
