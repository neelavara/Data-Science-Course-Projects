Guess what? Minivans are still uncool. Automakers know this. Even the latest ads for the <carMake>Honda</carMake> Odyssey and the <carMake>Toyota</carMake> Sienna acknowledge the squareness of the segment.

As a mature segment with little potential for growth, minivans are getting comfortable with their squareness. For evidence, we direct your attention to the new <carMake>Nissan</carMake> Quest, which not only acknowledges its one-box silhouette but drapes a metaphorical trench coat over the whole thing.
