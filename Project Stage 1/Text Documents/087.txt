For the 2017 model year <carMake>GM</carMake> tore the <carMake>GMC</carMake> model away from its fraternal triplets. The <carMake>Chevrolet</carMake> Traverse and <carMake>Buick</carMake> Enclave remain full-size vehicles, but the new Acadia leaves the family for a platform shared with the new and smaller <carMake>Cadillac</carMake> XT5. That means seating for a maximum of seven passengers.
