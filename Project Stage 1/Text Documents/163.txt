The executive summary is that high-volume automakers must make ZEVs a growing percentage of their annual sales. Here’s a highly simplified example: <carMake>Honda</carMake> currently sells about 225,000 cars per year in California. In 2015, it has to sell 2250 EVs to meet the mandate. Assuming <carMake>Honda’s</carMake> annual sales volume stays the same, it would have to sell 22,000 EVs per year by 2025. Just in California. Add in the seven Northeast states currently signed on, which account for 40 percent of <carMake>Honda’s</carMake> total sales volume, and you’re looking at 80,000 <carMake>Honda</carMake> EV sales per year by 2025.

However, one thing you should know is that since lawsuits in 2002 by <carMake>GM</carMake> and other players, California has considerably altered the rule, expanding the definition of ZEVs and creating an elaborate system of vehicle rankings and carbon credits (<carMake>Tesla</carMake> does a good business selling its abundance of credits to other companies), which permits automakers to fulfill their ZEV requirement using a variety of means.
