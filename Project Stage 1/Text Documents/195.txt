With its five-comparison-test winning streak, the current <carMake>BMW</carMake> M3 is our very own Ken Jennings, engineered to dominate our comparos. And, like Jennings, its success annoys some people. Administering beat-downs on some of the world’s best cars will do that. Up against the M3 this time is the 6.2-liter V-8–equipped <carMake>Mercedes-Benz</carMake> C63 AMG coupe. Based on the AMG-ified C-class sedan that the M3 previously defeated (December 2007), this C63 now sports two doors, a vastly improved interior, and a seven-speed automatic with a wet starting clutch instead of a torque converter. Engine power is slightly higher than that vanquished C63’s, thanks to the $6050 <carMake>AMG</carMake> Development package that takes horsepower up 30 to 481, or 67 more ponies than in the M3.
