For executives undergoing painful downsizing, may we suggest something in the $40,000 range, smart yet modest in posture compared with the usual CEO barge. Something in a sports sedan would keep the mood casual. Just in time, we have two new international choices: the bravely chiseled <carMake>Acura</carMake> TL and the softly molded <carMake>Audi</carMake> A4. The <carMake>Acura</carMake>, apart from its polarizing, sharply creased style, brings <carMake>Honda’s</carMake> Super Handling All-Wheel Drive to the middleweight sports class. The A4 brings variable lift on the exhaust valves of the 2.0-liter turbo four, upping output 11 horses to 211.
