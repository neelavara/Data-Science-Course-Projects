Inspiration, it seems, can come even from the trash dumpster. Or at least the area very near the dumpster behind C/D’s lavish headquarters. There, many trash-pickups ago, sat a silver <carMake>Jeep</carMake> Wrangler Unlimited with the optional body-colored fender flares ($100) and three-piece, body-colored hardtop ($1715). The positive effect of the body-colored attachments is shockingly strong. They transform the look of the Wrangler from that of mud-plugger/shirtless beach-trawler to something altogether more upscale and serious. They transform it into what appears to be a poor-man’s <carMake>Mercedes</carMake> G-wagen. Why <carMake>Jeep</carMake> didn’t start offering the Wrangler or its four-door Unlimited sibling this way decades ago is beyond us.
