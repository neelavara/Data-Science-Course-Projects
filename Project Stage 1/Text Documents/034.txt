Visually, the Camry’s infotainment system feels more integrated into the interior design. But functionally, the Accord’s is far more intuitive. The Camry’s control layout, both physical and digital, is confusing. A prime example: Pairing a phone to the Accord is not only a quicker, more intuitive process, but the display itself also sports a design like a smartphone and has crisper graphics. Only the Accord offers Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Because <carMake>Toyota</carMake> is in an intellectual property snit with the software giants, <carMake>Toyota</carMake> instead offers a downloadable suite of apps developed in-house—one of which is the Scout GPS Link App, which runs on your phone and projects on the infotainment screen. Both cars offer Wi-Fi hot spots on higher trims. For audiophiles, the Accord also has a richer-sounding stereo system across all trims.
As for driver aids to help avoid accidents, <carMake>Toyota</carMake> Safety Sense and <carMake>Honda</carMake> Sensing are standard on all models and offer similar features, including lane departure warning, lane keeping, forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, and adaptive cruise control. <carMake>Honda</carMake>’s system, however, is considerably more sophisticated than <carMake>Toyota</carMake>’s, particularly in lane keeping. <carMake>Toyota</carMake>’s system will make just enough of a steering correction to keep you from leaving your lane, at least on the first occasion. <carMake>Honda</carMake>’s system helps steer the car into corners and centers the car in its lane to some degree on straight roads. We also found <carMake>Honda</carMake>’s system to be more consistent in recognizing the lane lines. Both cars also provide blind-spot monitoring, rearview cameras, and optional parking sensors. The Camry, though, offers a 360-degree camera that no Accord does.
