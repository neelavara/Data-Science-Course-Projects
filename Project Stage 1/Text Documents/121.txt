Electric vehicles are maturing through their adolescence, and just like in middle school, some members of the class are developing faster. <carMake>Tesla</carMake> and <carMake>Chevrolet</carMake> now have electric cars that will travel more than 200 miles per charge, but the vast majority of battery-powered cars are still limited to a 60-to-90-mile range. In the next decade, the electric car promises to blossom into something that doesn’t require sacrifices in practicality or price when compared with a gas-fueled car, but until the EV’s pimples clear up, we have plug-in hybrids.

With both a battery and a gas tank, plug-in hybrids strive to be everything to everyone, especially buyers who drive too much to deal with range limitations or who don’t want to spend much time plugged into a charger. The battery pack provides some electric-only operation while the gas tank and engine keep things moving when the ­battery is tapped. <carMake>Chevrolet’s</carMake> first Volt could travel 38 miles on its battery; after that, the engine would kick on to drive the car. <carMake>Toyota</carMake>, the leader in hybrid sales, also sold a plug-in version of its ubiquitous Prius; it featured a lithium-ion battery pack and could travel 11 miles on electric-only power before burning any gas.
