Under its <carMake>Cadillac</carMake> skin, the new XTS conceals the skeleton of a <carMake>Buick</carMake> LaCrosse, which itself branches off the same family tree as the <carMake>Chevrolet</carMake> Malibu. And here’s the similarity: <carMake>Bentley’s</carMake> Continental Flying Spur also springs from humble roots. The Flying Spur shares its architecture with the defunct-in-the-U.S. <carMake>Volkswagen</carMake> Phaeton. So the <carMake>Bentley</carMake> is to a $70,000 <carMake>VW</carMake> as the <carMake>Cadillac</carMake> is to a $20,000 <carMake>Chevy</carMake>. Yes, the <carMake>Bentley’s</carMake> <carMake>VW</carMake> underpinnings are arguably more solid and refined—pricier, even—than the XTS. We’re not here to dispute that. What we seek to compare is the degree to which <carMake>Bentley</carMake> and <carMake>Cadillac</carMake> have sculpted the lumps of clay they were handed.
