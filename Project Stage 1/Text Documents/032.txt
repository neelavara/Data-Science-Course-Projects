As associate online editor Collin Woodard and I approach the vehicles, we find each is making a distinctive design statement—as if to show the dowdy family sedan can still be relevant and hip. The Camry presents itself as an evolution, its grille wider and <carMake>Toyota</carMake> badge thrust forward in a pouting prow. It’s a bold look but obviously recognizable as a Camry. The Accord’s brash, massive belt-buckle <carMake>Honda</carMake> badge leaves no question of its provenance. Neither nose strikes us as conventionally pretty.
Upon entering each car, we notice the Camry’s doors (on all trims) close with a hollow, tinny whumma not unlike a wobbly metal shed. The Accord’s close with the sturdy, reassuring thud of a luxury car. This as a shopper’s first tactile impression of the Camry will not help the <carMake>Toyota</carMake> salesforce.
