Take the cars. Yeah, it looks like the same 911 Carrera S, sprayed blue rather than yellow, but this “991.2” Carrera S is a werewolf in wolf’s clothing. The <carMake>Porsche</carMake>'s flat-six engine is now turbocharged and produces 20 more horsepower and 43 more lb-ft for 420 and 368, respectively. It features an optional rear-steering system, standard PASM active chassis control, an updated suspension and dual-clutch transmission, and a refreshed interior. The extra gizmos added about 100 pounds, but the extra grunt slightly improved the power-to-weight ratio.
