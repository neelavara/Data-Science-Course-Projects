Whether it’s basketball or boxing, everyone loves a hard-fought battle between two evenly matched rivals. Sure, a blowout is fun if your team wins, but the games that come down to the last second are the ones we talk about years later. This fight, between the redesigned 2017 <carMake>Honda</carMake> CR-V and the also all-new 2017 <carMake>Mazda</carMake> CX-5, is one of those fights.
About a year ago, we conducted a Big Test of the entire fleet of compact crossover SUVs, and the <carMake>Honda</carMake> and <carMake>Mazda</carMake> finished one-two—despite being at the tail end of their respective model cycles. That shows you how good they were: still the best even though the competition had four or five years to play catch-up. Now it’s <carMake>Honda</carMake> and <carMake>Mazda</carMake>’s time to set the benchmark yet again.
