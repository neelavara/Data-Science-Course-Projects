Any discussion of British automotive heraldry is not complete without a nod to <carMake>Land Rover</carMake> and its luxury line, Range Rover, which has been supplying four-low and lockers to the Queen’s household for as long as anyone can remember. The cheapest Range Rover you can buy (not the Sport and not the, ahem, ­Evoque, but the real Range Rover) is $85,945. The cheapest long-wheelbase Ranger is $109,190. So it is not unfair to say that our long-wheelbase SVAutobiography, at $202,935, is a car with, more or less, a hundred grand in options. Believe it or not, there’s a Holland & Holland model that goes for $245,495, but avoid that one because, you know, you’ll shoot your eye out, kid.

Meanwhile, <carMake>Volkswagen</carMake>-owned <carMake>Bentley</carMake> has named its first SUV after a rocky partridge roost on an island off Africa’s western coast, proving that Germans are hilarious even when they’re not trying to be. Our $281,100 <carMake>Bentley</carMake> Bentayga came rendered in Hallmark Metallic with Beluga-­over-Camel-colored leather and a veneer of “dark, fiddleback eucalyptus,” indicating that the Bentayga’s catalog reads like an issue of Wine Spectator. In testing, this 5703-pound sled was exactly as quick in the quarter-mile as a <carMake>Ferrari</carMake> F40, and it amuses the imagination to wonder what songs Gilbert and Sullivan would have written about this very model of a modern minor miracle.

Buying the 600-hp Bentayga or the 550-hp Range Rover would not be at all like buying a Roller or a <carMake>Mercedes-Benz</carMake> S-class or a <carMake>Cadillac</carMake> limo with a boomerang aerial or any of the big cars we formerly associated with financial achievement. That’s because these mega-dollar utes eschew the baroque pageantry that used to define luxury cars in favor of a new hyperposh utilitarianism akin to a diamond-studded Leatherman. Call it clodhopper chic.
