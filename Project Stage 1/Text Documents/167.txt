Next is the model that was once the ultimate bogey for <carMake>Cadillac</carMake>: the <carMake>BMW</carMake> 5-series. Specifically, we asked for the face-lifted-for-2014, rear-drive 535i. That not being available, we accepted a four-wheel-drive 535i, powered by the 302-hp, turbocharged inline-six. Thanks to its M Sport package ($3150) and a couple of expensive convenience bundles, the 535i rang in as our priciest entrant at $67,600.

To finish out the German trifecta, we grabbed a <carMake>Mercedes-Benz</carMake> E350, which, like the <carMake>BMW</carMake>, has been face-lifted for 2014.
