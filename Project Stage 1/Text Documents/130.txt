Similarly, there are <carMake>Ford</carMake> Mustang people and <carMake>Chevy</carMake> Camaro people. And there are fans of turbos and adherents to naturally aspirated mills. Convenient, then, that we just happen to have a Heinz-red Mustang EcoBoost and a French’s-yellow Camaro LT V-6. And if you think this sounds like a very elaborate scheme to justify expensing a lunch of old-school sliders and fries at southwest Detroit’s venerable Telway Hamburgers stand, well, you’re not entirely correct.

That’s because in any war between turbocharged engines and naturally aspirated ones, the Mustang/Camaro battle is unique, important, and extremely worthy of contemplation. As of this year, each company serves up its sports coupe with a choice of three engines: a turbocharged four-cylinder, a V-6, and a V-8. Where the two companies differ is in the placement of these engines in their hierarchies. <carMake>Ford</carMake>, the first to turbocharge its current model, regards the EcoBoost as its middle-rung Mustang—the performance-oriented pony car for those who don’t want to pony up for the V-8. It’s powered by a 310-hp 2.3-liter four-cylinder and is offered with the full ­complement of performance- and luxury-enhancing options. The base Mustang is the one powered by the 300-hp 3.7-liter V-6. It is mostly foisted on rental-car companies, and <carMake>Ford</carMake> offers it with none of the options that a performance enthusiast might crave.
