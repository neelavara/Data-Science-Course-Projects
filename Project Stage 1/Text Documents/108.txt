What is luxury, after all, if it doesn’t include a healthy portion of comfort? Comfort begins at the road and ends quite literally in the driver’s seat. This means every element in between is important, from the tire size and construction through the suspension and bushing tuning to the body structural rigidity and finally to the quality of the padding and leather used for seats. Combined, these account for a great deal of perceived luxury. Designers love 20- and 21-inch wheels because they look cool. Suspension engineers, however, know that their added mass and short, stiff tire sidewalls make it hard to deliver a smooth ride and nimble handling. Both the <carMake>Lincoln</carMake> and <carMake>Mercedes-Benz</carMake> featured self-adjusting and driver-selectable suspensions, and on our rotations among the three, only one thing was unanimous: The <carMake>Lexus</carMake> RX 350 F Sport got it wrong. Without the option of a more intelligent suspension and with soft springs and conventional dampers, the RX 350’s ride oscillated between pillowy soft and jarring when abrupt seams or bumps met the tires. Meanwhile, the MKX and GLC300 minimized impact harshness while providing a smooth ride; the Lincoln provided a more isolated road feel than the <carMake>Mercedes</carMake>, which felt equally sophisticated but better planted. Also, these two could be switched to a firmer setting at the press of a button, something the Lexus was unable to do.
