We put in the search criteria for a suitable rival to the new <carMake>Dodge</carMake>, including that it had to come through a factory-certified pre-owned (CPO) program to ensure cherryness, and out popped an off-lease 2008 <carMake>Mercedes-Benz</carMake> E63 AMG with 23,000 miles. 

It makes sense: The Charger and the <carMake>Benz</carMake> share platform DNA. The E63’s original sticker price of $95,740 has shrunk in the dryer of depreciation to $52,000—<carMake>Dodge</carMake> territory. All you would need is a couple of extra platinum Visas to pay the <carMake>Benz’s</carMake> repair bill when the stückenthingenwirtläutner goes up in smoke for the 29th time.
