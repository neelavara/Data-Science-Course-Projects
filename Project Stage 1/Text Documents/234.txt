The <carMake>BMW</carMake> 5 Series has been considered the standard for executive sport sedans for decades. 
But when something is held in such high regard, it tends to hold a higher price tag.
That can leave buyers who want a high-end experience but don’t have a high-end budget feeling 
left out, but that’s where <carMake>Genesis</carMake> steps in. This luxury brand is new on the scene and is looking 
to take on the established players in the segment by offering high-end luxury without the high-end price.
The products <carMake>Genesis</carMake> offers have fared well against premium automakers like <carMake>Cadillac</carMake>
and <carMake>Volvo</carMake>, but it’s about time to see if the Korean luxury brand can stand toe-to-toe with the industry’s 
gold standard cars.
