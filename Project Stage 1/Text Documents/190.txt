The <carMake>Ford</carMake> Escape and the <carMake>Mazda</carMake> CX-5 are all-new this year, so their inclusion was a no-brainer. While the CX-5 comes with just one engine, its four-wheel drive and Grand Touring trim bring its cost in line. The Escape offers a trio of engine choices: A naturally aspirated, 2.5-liter inline-four is stand­ard in front-drivers; a turbocharged 1.6-liter four is standard in four-wheel-drive models; and a 2.0-liter turbo four is optional in both.

Not quite as new but still warm from the oven, the latest <carMake>Honda</carMake> CR-V, like the CX-5, comes only with a naturally aspirated four-pot. A $30,000 CR-V comes in EX-L trim (“L” for leather), with enough left over for a rear-seat DVD player/babysitter.
