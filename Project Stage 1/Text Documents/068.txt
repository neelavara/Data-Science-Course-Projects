Decades of automotive history have forged a clear idea of what an M car should be. M originally stood for Motorsport, so a car wearing its badge will trade some of <carMake>BMW</carMake>’s trademark comfort for performance. An M car will have a high-revving engine, rear-wheel drive, and immediate handling. It should have a manual transmission where possible, and if not, at least no torque converter. It should be lightweight to foster nimble handling, and although its high price will make it appeal to every attorney trudging through Beverly Hills, it should feel most at home on a lonely mountain road.
