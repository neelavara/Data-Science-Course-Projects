The <carMake>Porsche</carMake> Macan GTS isn’t the smallest, but it feels like it. The cabin is cramped and gets uncomfortable after an hour or so behind the wheel. The seats give up too much comfort in exchange for sporty support. Dynamically, the Macan delivers the thrill of acceleration, sprinting from 0 to 60 mph in 4.5 seconds. That’s the quickest run here—and on standard all-season tires to boot. It ties the <carMake>Mercedes</carMake> (shod with summer tires) with a 13.4-second quarter-mile run, but at a slower 99.1-mph trap speed. The uprated front brakes from the Macan Turbo help the GTS nail the 60–0 stop in 112 feet, and it lays down brand-appropriate numbers in figure-eight testing with its 25.0-second time at 0.75 g average.
