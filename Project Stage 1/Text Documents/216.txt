<carMake>Bentley</carMake> has the most experience in the tiny entry-opulent segment. In 2004, it made the move down-market with its hugely successful, <carMake>VW</carMake> Phaeton–based, $155K Continental GT coupe. Then the spinoffs began. In 2006, the GT spawned the Flying Spur sedan, and then the Flying Spur Speed for model-year 2009, which upgrades the Spur’s 552-hp, 6.0-liter twin-turbo W-12 to 600 horsepower and 553 pound-feet of torque. The suspension is lower and stiffer for better control at speeds approaching <carMake>Bentley’s</carMake> claimed terminal velocity of 200 mph.

<carMake>Rolls-Royce</carMake> is only now releasing its entry-opulent car, the new-for-2010 Ghost (Ghosts apparently being less supernatural than Phantoms). The car shares some componentry with another high roller also built by the Ghost’s owner, <carMake>BMW</carMake>—the V-12–powered 760Li—but is 7.3 inches longer (which includes a bonus 3.3 between the wheels), 1.8 inches wider, and 2.7 inches taller. The Rolls name comes from its past, the Silver Ghost being the model that established <carMake>Rolls-Royce’s</carMake> reputation for waftability in the early 20th century.
