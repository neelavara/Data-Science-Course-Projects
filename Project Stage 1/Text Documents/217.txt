And so go the wars among the $50,000 luxo-sports sedans, a burgeoning and combative niche whose inhabitants seemingly engage in almost monthly one-upmanship. In fact, it was just last September that we ran our “Five at Fifty” comparo, in which a quintet of 50-grand execuliners duked it out. In that battle, an <carMake>Audi</carMake> A6 3.0T Quattro prevailed, followed not far behind by a <carMake>BMW</carMake> 535i and an <carMake>Infiniti</carMake> M45. Since then, the would-be <carMake>Audi</carMake> slayers have comprehensively renovated their products, so another war—this one surely a war to end war—seemed justified.
