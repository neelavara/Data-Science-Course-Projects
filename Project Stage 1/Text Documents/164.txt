 <carMake>Kia</carMake> now sells more than 100,000 of its box-that-it-came-in hatchbacks a year. Renewed for 2014, the new Soul looks an awful lot like the old Soul but shares not one body panel with its pred­eces­sor. The naming convention of IKEA’s furniture lines might seem odd outside Scandinavia, but the Soul is <carMake>Kia’s</carMake> best attempt at mirroring the likes of Esbjörn and Sångfågel. The top-level trim tested here is a Soul! (say “Soul Exclaim”) painted “Alien II” green and loaded up with every major option, including the “Whole Shabang” package, which includes heated and ventilated front seats, heated rears, and a heated steering wheel. All that Vittsjö pushes the price from the Soul’s $15,495 entry point to $26,195.

<carMake>Fiat’s</carMake> 500L makes its debut for 2014. While its name is derived from that of <carMake>Fiat’s</carMake> one other U.S. offering, and it wears a similar moustache badge, it’s built in a different factory. The L comes from Serbia instead of Italy or Mexico on a different platform that Fiat calls “small-wide.” (Better than “short-fat.”) It does, however, borrow the 500 <carMake>Abarth’s</carMake> turbocharged 1.4-liter MultiAir four-cylinder. The base Pop trim starts at $19,995, but upgrade to the top-of-the-line Lounge model and add in a few lingon­berries like a two-row sunroof and a Beats Audio system, and you end up at $28,245.

We’ve omitted the <carMake>Scion</carMake> xB. It has been dead to us since its 2008 redesign, when it abandoned its roots. And we expect the <carMake>Nissan</carMake> Cube to be dead to, well, everybody in the near future. <carMake>Mini’s</carMake> Countryman is an obvious competitor, but the company couldn’t furnish one with front-wheel drive. Which leaves us with these two IKEA-class cruisers, which we’ve taken to the very halls of their inspiration. We’ll see if they can muster all the flair of a $565 living-room set, along with the cargo capacity to haul it all home.
