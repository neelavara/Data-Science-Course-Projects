The ramifications of the crossover—or, more accurately, the unibody SUV—are still vibrating through the luxury segment. Americans just can’t get enough of these pricey family haulers, and buyers are even beginning to choose them over like-sized sedans. To wit: <carMake>Audi</carMake> expects the new Q7 to outsell the A6 in a year or two, and the <carMake>BMW</carMake> X5 already trumps the 5-series.

And more Americans take home a <carMake>Land Rover</carMake> Range Rover Sport than <carMake>Jaguar</carMake> sells cars, a big factor in <carMake>Jag’s</carMake> decision to build the forthcoming F-Pace SUV.
