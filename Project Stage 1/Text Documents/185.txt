In our world, <carMake>BMW</carMake> M6 and <carMake>Chevy</carMake> Camaro ZL1 owners buy these cars because they are going to use them. And not just use them, but use every last horsepower and g of capability. We admit that we do not live in the real world. While some owners actually track and race their M6s and ZL1s, many others use them almost exclusively for phallic demonstration. For these buyers, convertibles hold a big advantage. Liberating experiential factors aside, preening is one of the big benefits of convertibles over coupes. People tend to notice cars like an M6 or a ZL1; people tend to notice the driver of the equivalent convertible.

If the goal is showmanship, then the M6 seen here arrived in the appropriate hue. <carMake>BMW</carMake> calls it San Marino Blue Metallic, but we’d have gone with peacock blue. Returning to market after a brief respite, the M6 convertible equips its driver well for chest puffery.
