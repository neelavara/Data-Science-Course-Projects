Should <carMake>BMW</carMake> falter, the <carMake>Cadillac</carMake> ATS leads in the running to be ordained supreme pontiff of sports sedans. In its loss to the 328i, we called the four-cylinder ATS “the best-handling sports sedan on the market today.” Its coarse turbo-four was a main culprit in that outcome; the example tested here has <carMake>GM’s</carMake> modern 3.6-liter V-6 with 321 horses and 275 pound-feet. <carMake>Cadillac’s</carMake> sport package is the FE3 perform­ance suspension that includes <carMake>GM’s</carMake> magnetorheological shocks and a ­limited-slip differential. The ATS’s $49,185 sticker shows just how bent Cadillac is on beating <carMake>BMW</carMake> on a level playing field.

The emergent entry in this segment is the <carMake>Lexus</carMake> IS350. Architecturally a scaled-down <carMake>Lexus</carMake> GS, it’s 3.4 inches longer and a touch wider and taller than its predecessor. There’s a significant 2.7-inch stretch in wheelbase, and added size means added mass. The last generation’s 3.5-liter V-6 carries over with 306 horsepower and 277 pound-feet, although an eight-speed automatic helps both acceleration and fuel economy against the <carMake>Lexus’s</carMake> heaviest-in-test 3705 pounds. The F Sport package tweaks spring rates and damper tuning, plus it adds a more aggressive fascia and other decoration. Fresh from its debut, the IS doesn’t have an official price yet, but figure this one should go for around $49,000.
