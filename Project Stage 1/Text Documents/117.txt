This is a fantasy comparison test, but not our usual kind. There is no exotic sheetmetal on display here, no towering horsepower or physics-defying handling. Certainly nobody daydreams about driving 300 miles without leaving Los Angeles. But that’s exactly what we did to evaluate the <carMake>Honda</carMake> Clarity and <carMake>Toyota</carMake> Mirai, tracing a path between each of the area’s hydrogen stations to assess the reality of owning one of these fuel-cell-powered cars. Yes, you read that correctly. No longer does hitching your wagon to the periodic table require leasing a carmaker’s science project with a promise to return it, whether or not you’re done driving it, at least not if you spend $58,385 for the Mirai. A federal tax credit expired at the end of last year, but a $5000 rebate from the state of California still reduces this amount. Even so, goosed lease rates mean most of those traveling the hydrogen highway will remain tenants. <carMake>Toyota</carMake> will let you drive a Mirai for $349 a month for three years, including free hydrogen. A similar deal from <carMake>Honda</carMake> runs $369. Its second-generation Clarity—on sale since December 2016—is lease-only, with a nominal $59,365 MSRP. The cars are available solely in California.
