Every car is defined by a series of compromises, tradeoffs, and decisions that achieve one goal at the expense of others. The performance derivatives of the <carMake>BMW</carMake> 6 Series Gran Coupe define compromise—whether to emphasize style over function.
We just can’t decide which set we like better. There are two Gran Coupes fighting for the top spot: the M6 and the Alpina B6, both of which you can buy from a <carMake>BMW</carMake> dealership with a full factory warranty. Both wear the same sexy body. They have different engines, but in a weird parallel both are twin-turbocharged V-8s that crank out 600 tarmac-tearing horsepower. Even their base prices are similar. At a mere $3,400 apart, that’s a rounding error at their six-figure price points.
