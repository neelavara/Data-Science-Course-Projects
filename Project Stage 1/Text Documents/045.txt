For 2017, the CR-V moves to the new Civic platform, which spawned the sedan we’re also enamored with. Like the Civic, the new CR-V rides and handles considerably better than before, so much so that my notes read: “I think I could seriously scare the average person with what this crossover is capable of on a back road.”
The CX-5, by contrast, is more of a wild child. As with other <carMake>Mazda</carMake>s, the rear end feels slightly loose, as if it wants to rotate just slightly and point you into corners. The CX-5’s center of gravity doesn’t feel as low as the CR-Vs, though, and the weight transfer happens much more quickly, so you have to slow down your steering inputs and drive more deliberately. Neither vehicle’s front-biased all-wheel-drive system made itself known behind the wheel, nor did either seem to affect the steering much. The <carMake>Mazda</carMake>’s steering feel is heavier, and the <carMake>Honda</carMake>’s feels more naturally weighted.
