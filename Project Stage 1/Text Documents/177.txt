No conversation involving automotive cubicles is complete without the boss, the <carMake>Honda</carMake> Accord. New for 2013, it is the quintes­sential family sedan, refined, spacious, and practical. The latest Accord has vanquished every mid-size foe it has faced so far and landed—for the 27th time—on our 10Best list.

For this round, we brought together loaded four-cylinder versions of the Accord and 6. As the highest trim level available with <carMake>Honda’s</carMake> 2.4-liter four-cylinder, the CVT-equipped Accord EX-L features leather, collision and lane-departure warnings, navigation, and the novel blind-spot camera for $30,785. Up on <carMake>Mazda’s</carMake> top shelf is the 6 Grand Touring. Available exclusively with a six-speed automatic, our $31,490 6 arrived equipped almost identically as the Accord, with the exception of its optional automatic cruise control.
