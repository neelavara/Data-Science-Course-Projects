Be honest. You can spend a week with one of two cars: the <carMake>Ford</carMake> Focus RS or the <carMake>Ford</carMake> Mustang Shelby GT350R. Or for Europhiles, it’s a decision between a <carMake>Porsche</carMake> 911 and a 718 Boxster S. You can’t choose both, but you get to beat on your selection as hard as you like on both a closed road and a racetrack. Chevron is paying for the gas. That Focus RS is a cool hot hatch. But if you’re being honest—really, truly, hand-on-a-holy-book honest—you choose the Shelby.
