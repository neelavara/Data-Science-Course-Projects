The fully loaded <carMake>Kia</carMake> Rio EX hatchback maxes out at under that price point and the <carMake>Honda</carMake> Fit LX we have also 
squeezed under that price tag. But which one is the better buy? It’s not always a clear-cut answer because 
some buyers might want the most car for the money, while others will want a car that doesn’t feel as low cost 
as it actually is. The <carMake>Honda</carMake> Fit gets a pretty significant refresh this year. Our tester is the LX model, 
but with the added functionality of the <carMake>Honda</carMake> Sensing suite of safety and driver assistance technology, 
it swings in at just under $19,000 — and you get a lot of car for that price.
