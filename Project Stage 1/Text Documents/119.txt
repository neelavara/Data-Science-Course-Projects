Absent that, we submit to you four excellent candidates for mono-auto households. Please note that while they are all hatchbacks, none are crossovers because a tall center of gravity and unnecessary weight do not fit our mission. To this test we mainly invited old friends. Two of our cars, the <carMake>Mazda</carMake> 3 and the <carMake>Volkswagen</carMake> Golf, in their current forms, have already distinguished themselves in past tests. The <carMake>Honda</carMake> Civic hatchback is new for 2017, though the platform, introduced last year, is familiar and much approved of in our office. The <carMake>Chevy</carMake> Cruze hatchback also rides on a known hardware set but sails in from Mexico (SAD!) as a newcomer intended mainly for overseas markets. We also asked for the new <carMake>Subaru</carMake> Impreza, but manual versions were delayed and unavailable at the time. They should be in stores now.
