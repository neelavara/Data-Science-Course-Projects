For the first time in history, a production Mustang 5.0 displaces more than 5,000 cubic centimeters. The old Coyote V-8 displaced 4,951 cubes. <carMake>Ford</carMake> Performance changed out the cylinder liners, using the same plasma transferred wire arc process as the GT supercar. As such, the bore is now 93mm (up nearly a millimeter), and total displacement is 5,038cc. Because the bore is larger, the valves can be (and are) larger. The cylinder heads are new, as are the camshafts, the crankshaft, and the rod bearings. This new engine also revs 500 rpm higher to 7,500 rpm. The 2018 Coyote engine provides both port and direct injection, and because of the cooling effect of DI, the compression ratio is now a relatively lofty 12:1. As you’ve probably guessed by now, power is up, going from 435 to 460 horsepower (5 hp more than Chevy). Torque also is up by 20 lb-ft to 420 lb-ft (though 35 less than Chevy). The six-speed manual sports new gears, optimized for the engine’s healthier output.
The 2018 Mustang also gets updated and—according to my Instagram followers—polarizing new sheetmetal. <carMake>Ford<carMake>’s decision to take the Mustang global means that the car is subject to Europe’s restrictive pedestrian safety regulations, which often have an adverse effect on design. That’s the why the headlights are so tiny while the hood is so bulbous.
