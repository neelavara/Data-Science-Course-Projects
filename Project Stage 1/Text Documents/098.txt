The GT-R, too, has much to fear—especially given its inefficient powertrain layout, which includes a front-mounted V-6, a rear-mounted transaxle, and driveshafts heading in both directions. That system adds not only actual mass but also visual mass. Parked next to the low, wide <carMake>Acura</carMake>, the <carMake>Nissan</carMake> looks like a tall, blunt-nosed SUV.
Yet somehow the aluminum and carbon-fiber NSX weighs just 60 pounds less than the GT-R. The only significant difference is where that weight is located. When standing still, the <carMake>Nissan</carMake>’s front wheels carry a nearly unbelievable 537 more pounds than the <carMake>Acura</carMake>’s.
