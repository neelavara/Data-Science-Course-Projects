It’s harder to hit a moving target, and <carMake>BMW</carMake> renewed the 3-series for 2012. Internally designated F30, the new generation is longer and structurally stiffer but no heavier than the outgoing E90. The much-loved naturally aspirated inline-six that powered the base car is now gone, replaced by a turbocharged four that makes 10 more horsepower and 55 more pound-feet of torque. So we guess maybe that’s okay with us. What isn’t okay with us is a base price that is inching closer to $40,000. With just a few add-ons—Sport Line trim, sunroof, and adaptive suspension the big-ticket items among them—the car tested here rang up at $45,145.

 
<carMake>Cadillac’s</carMake> most recent attempt at 3-series emulation was the CTS, an ambitious tweener that hoped to steal sales from <carMake>BMW’s</carMake> 3- and 5-series with a single blow. This time around, the company started where identity thieves usually do: the target’s garbage.
