The <carMake>Ford</carMake> falls somewhere between the <carMake>Dodge</carMake> and Chevy on the stiff end and <carMake>Nissan</carMake> on the soft end of the ride and handling spectrum. Equipped with an optional off-road-oriented package featuring an off-road tire, it suffers from far fewer ride and handling trade-offs than the Tahoe. “It has impressive body control,” associate editor Scott Evans said. “There’s surprisingly little body roll for such a large vehicle, and it rolls over onto the outside wheels smoothly every time.” The Expedition handles pretty well, too, with accurate but not talkative feedback from the wheel.
SUVs in this segment have come a long way on the ride and handling front—something we were all reminded of once we took our first turns in the <carMake>Toyota</carMake> Sequoia. The big <carMake>Toyota</carMake> has soldiered on without any significant changes for a decade, putting it far behind the rest of the pack in automotive development. The Sequoia’s steering requires constant corrections to stay centered in a straight line. It doesn’t get any better through turns, either. “Driving this reminds me how bad <carMake>Toyota</carMake> steering used to be; it’s way overboosted with extremely vague on-center feel,” news editor Alex Nishimoto said. Fortunately for the <carMake>Toyota</carMake>, it rides acceptably, though executive editor Mark Rechtin noted that there’s “a lot of side-to-side shudder with a lot of head toss over very minor bumps in the road.”
