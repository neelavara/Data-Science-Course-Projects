The coolest change to me is the big 12.4-inch instrument panel. It’s bright and readable, has different displays for different modes (the Track screen, specifically the way <carMake>Ford</carMake> made the tachometer look, is particularly good), and works well with the Mustang’s pleasant innards. Sadly, like too many <carMake>Ford</carMake> screens these days, there’s too much information displayed and/or something always prompting you to hit “OK.”
Ticking the box for Performance Pack 1 adds such features as a big wing; black aluminum wheels; Michelin PS4 tires; Brembo brakes; a dual-mode exhaust; a strut tower brace; a K-brace; stiffer front springs; a thicker rear anti-roll bar; a larger radiator; a Torsen limited-slip differential; retuned electric steering assist, stability control, and ABS; and “unique chassis tuning.” To even up things as much as possible, our test car had optional magnetic dampers, MagneRide in <carMake>Ford</carMake>-speak. Sadly, we asked for but didn’t get the available Recaro sport seats. Total price: $49,670, a $9,675 jump over the GT’s base price. Does the Mustang feel $3,375 more special than the Camaro? No. However, the <carMake>Ford</carMake>’s interior does look and feel about $2K nicer.
