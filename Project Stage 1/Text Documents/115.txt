Choosing our roster seemed difficult at first, as there are now more than a dozen competitors in the segment. Clearly, we had to invite back our 2011 winner, as the <carMake>Dodge</carMake> Durango is still on the market and, in fact, relatively unchanged. Sharing its underpinnings with the <carMake>Jeep</carMake> Grand Cherokee, the <carMake>Dodge</carMake> is unlike the rest of this field in that its 3.6-liter V-6 is mounted longitudinally and sends the majority of its torque to the rear wheels. The atavistic Durango can be configured with two rows of seats, but, of course, we opted for three, with second-row captain’s chairs swapped for the bench, reducing maximum seating from seven to six. In GT trim, our Durango carried an as-tested price of $49,065. The 2017 <carMake>GMC</carMake> Acadia is in its first model year of a ground-up reengineering, and the long-awaited 2018 <carMake>Volkswagen</carMake> Atlas is brand new, so these also made the cut.
