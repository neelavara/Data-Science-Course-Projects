But a few shafts of light have started to pierce the heavy blanket of crossover conformity. <carMake>Porsche’s</carMake> first glimmer of hope, the Cayenne, dates to before most people realized the market potential of a high-performance crossover. In its first year on the market, the Cayenne became <carMake>Porsche’s</carMake> best-selling model. The creators of the Pink Pig learned lessons from their new 5000-pound supersow, and the smaller, <carMake>Audi</carMake> Q5–based Macan has already dethroned the Cayenne as the brand’s sales leader. The example tested here is the new-for-2017 GTS, which splits the difference between the $55,450, 340-hp S model and the $77,050, 400-horse Turbo.

<carMake>Jaguar’s<carMake> beacon of hope is new for 2017. Never mind that <carMake>Land Rover</carMake> functions as the SUV arm of jointly owned <carMake>Jaguar</carMake> <carMake>Land Rover</carMake>; to get Americans to pay attention, every brand needs its own crossover. <carMake>Jaguar</carMake> plows a lot of aluminum into the F-Pace, using the lightweight stuff for most of the body structure and suspension components. A diesel four-cylinder is the base engine, but the likely volume engines are a pair of aluminum V-6s shared with the F-type.
