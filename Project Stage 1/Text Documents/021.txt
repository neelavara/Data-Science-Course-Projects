There was a time when <carMake>Lexus</carMake> was seen as the new kid on the block challenging the established German automakers. Nowadays, <carMake>Lexus</carMake> is part of that establishment, and its latest fifth-generation LS is arguably the best since the original. Sporting bold styling to emphasize its confident stature in the face of Europe’s best, our LS 500 AWD tester costs around $103,000.
Just as the original <carMake>Lexus</carMake> LS disrupted the luxury car space in 1989 with equivalent luxury to the Germans for a cut-rate price, <carMake>Hyundai</carMake> Motor is hoping to do the same with its upstart Genesis brand—representing South Korea’s sole global luxury brand is the 2018 Genesis G90 AWD 3.3T. Taking the place of the <carMake>Hyundai</carMake> Equus, the G90 is a remarkable effort at a luxury flagship, putting aside any questions as to whether the Koreans can do more than just imitate. And much like <carMake>Lexus</carMake> once did, the G90 takes a chainsaw to its competition’s price premium by selling for $71,825.
