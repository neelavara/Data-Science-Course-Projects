Ridiculous, maybe, but that’s what you have to spend in this segment. The <carMake>Volkswagen</carMake> Golf R costs an almost identical $36,470 in base four-door manual form, and $40,010 with options. With a 292-hp version of <carMake>Volkswagen’s</carMake> 2.0-liter turbocharged four, it’s down on power compared with the RS and has a less advanced Haldex four-wheel-drive system that can’t match the <carMake>Ford’s</carMake> clever torque biasing. The R is the only car here available with an automatic option—<carMake>Volkswagen’s</carMake> familiar six-speed dual-clutch DSG—but resisting it, as we would urge you to, saves $1100 and 80 pounds.

Finally, an outlier: the <carMake>Subaru</carMake> WRX STI, distinguished from the others by the fact that it’s a sedan rather than a hatchback, and because <carMake>Subaru</carMake> has somehow managed to supply us with a U.S.-spec car on Illinois dealer tags. With no front license plate of any kind, it should make any encounter with les gendarmes interesting. The WRX shares the same mechanical ­layout that <carMake>Subaru</carMake> has championed for decades, as if it were presented to them by the Almighty on carved tablets. A turbocharged flat-four supplies power to all ­corners through a center differential with front-to-rear adjustable torque bias on the STI, and with limited-slip diffs at each end. For $35,490 to start, it’s slightly cheaper than the others, but a comprehensive options workout makes it the priciest car here when ­sampled, as they say in France, a la carte.
