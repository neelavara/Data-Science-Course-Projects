After a four-decade hiatus, <carMake>Mercedes</carMake> is back to building full-size convertibles. Save your letters; we’re not counting the E-class–based 1993–95 cabriolet because it did not achieve true pulchritude. In no dimension, except maybe build quality, does it measure up to this S-class–derived four-seater. Available in three flavors, <carMake>Merc’s</carMake> convertible is a leather-packed bullet aimed squarely at the <carMake>Bentley</carMake> Continental GT convertible. Constant updates have kept the now 12-year-old Continental as relevant as any car costing more than $200 large can credibly be.

Admittedly, when conducting a comparison of cars this ludicrously expensive, logic is trumped by baser stuff. <carMake>Cadillac</carMake> certainly wasn’t thinking logically when it built its 8.2-liter V-8. Just as with old stars that grow so large they collapse upon themselves, <carMake>Cadillac’s</carMake> 500-cubic-inch supergiant, in its final year, made just 190 horsepower (215 with fuel injection) and 360 pound-feet of torque, numbers that <carMake>Mercedes</carMake> can now match with a 2.1-liter turbo-­diesel. But with two turbochargers and more than 500 horsepower each, these modern V-8s certainly recall that <carMake>Cadillac’s</carMake> excess.

<carMake>Bentley</carMake> and <carMake>Mercedes</carMake> do offer larger 12-cylinder engines, but we chose the V-8 versions because upping the cylinder count adds weight, complexity, and cost without, in our opinion, improving the driving experience. Okay, so sometimes logic does trump ­emotion, even in the illogical world of the big convertible.
