We don’t like putting any magnificent <carMake>Mercedes</carMake> in last place. Sadly though, the C-class’ inherent greatness didn’t survive the transformation from excellent luxury sedan to top-flight sport sedan as well as its peers.
At 503 hp, the V-8’s peak output is a rounding error less than the best-in-class <carMake>Alfa Romeo</carMake>’s, but its two extra pistons and 1,091-cc additional displacement help it best the Italian V-6’s maximum twist by 73 very sonorous lb-ft of torque. Although the AMG is almost 150 pounds porkier than the next-heaviest <carMake>Cadillac</carMake>, the brute’s underhood muscle put it in the thick of the quarter-mile drag race – and still delivered the best city fuel economy. We are slightly disappointed that for AMG duty <carMake>Mercedes</carMake> replaced the torque converter in its seven-speed automatic with a multi-plate clutchpack whose programming allows far too much slippage and not enough smoothness off the line. The torque converter would have been way better.
