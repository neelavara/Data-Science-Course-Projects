As for burnouts, the orange <carMake>Ford</carMake> literally, figuratively, and ever other way smoked the Chevy. In a way, this is actually good news for the 1LE. Here’s why: The Camaro can do about one, maybe two decent burnouts, and then the Goodyears get hot to the point where they “grip up,” to steal a term from Randy Pobst. It’s enough grip that 455 lb-ft of twisting force has trouble breaking ’em loose. This is slightly surprising.
I used to tell anyone who would listen to me that the best production burnout machine on earth was either the 2015 <carMake>Jaguar</carMake> F-Type R (it was rear-drive for one year only—future classic!) or any Hellcat. Then I drove a Camaro ZL1 and melted six sets of rear tires. Not joking.
