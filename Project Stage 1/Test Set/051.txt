All six wee boxes here bear traces of subcompact-hatchback DNA. The segment leader, the <carMake>Kia</carMake> Soul, shares its underpinnings with the <carMake>Kia</carMake> Rio. Renewed in 2014, the Soul took first place in a previous comparison test and is also the market’s favorite, with the American public annually snapping up more than 100,000 of these Korean parcels. Soul pricing starts just over $16,000, while the Soul + tested here—with its 164-hp 2.0-liter four, panoramic sunroof, keyless entry and starting, and heated and ventilated front seats—rings in at $24,750. It’s the only vehicle in this gathering that isn’t four-wheel drive, because <carMake>Kia</carMake> doesn’t offer it that way.

Like the Soul, the <carMake>Jeep</carMake> Renegade has the profile of a car drawn by a four-year-old—a short rectangle atop a longer one atop some circular wheels. All-new for 2015, the Renegade shares its platform with the Fiat 500X, right down to its 101.2-inch wheelbase. With the test’s most powerful engine—also shared with the <carMake>Fiat</carMake>—sending 180 horsepower through a nine-speed automatic transmission, our Renegade Latitude 4x4 stickers at $26,360.

Still upright, but less of a cubist’s delight, is the <carMake>Chevrolet</carMake> Trax. Buick, of all brands, was one of the pioneers in the subcompact-crossover class. After sales of the <carMake>Buick</carMake> Encore surprised the suits, <carMake>General Motors</carMake> made the call to start shipping the more affordable <carMake>Chevy</carMake>—already available overseas—to the States. The $15,000 Sonic lends its platform and its 1.4-liter turbocharged four. Our four-wheel-drive LT checks in at $25,540.

The <carMake>Fiat</carMake> 500X, <carMake>Honda</carMake> HR-V, and <carMake>Mazda</carMake> CX-3 serve as the rectilinear subset’s foils. Their sculpted bodies suggest an athleticism that, if realized, ought to give them a leg up on the box-car set. From certain angles, the new-for-2016 <carMake>Fiat</carMake> 500X has the look of an embryonic <carMake>Porsche</carMake> Macan. The Easy trim level is just the second of five tiers, but this one is loaded with Beats audio, a panoramic sunroof, parking sensors, and a rearview camera. It rings in just shy of 30 grand, at $29,100.
