The battery in our rear-drive single-motor <carMake>Tesla</carMake> Model S, nominally a 60-kW-hr battery with an EPA-rated range of 210 miles, is actually a 75-kW-hr battery limited to 60 kW-hr of charge. Model S 60 buyers can go online and plop down their Amex (in this scenario we imagine all <carMake>Tesla</carMake> owners are Platinum Card holders), and a $9,000 over-the-air update later, their Model S 60 has turned into a Model S 75 with 234 miles of range. We actually did the 75-kW-hr update to “our” Model S 60 after the majority of this comparison test was executed just to see if it works as advertised. (It did.)
