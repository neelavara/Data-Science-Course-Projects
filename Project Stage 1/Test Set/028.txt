The <carMake>Chevrolet</carMake> Bolt EV and <carMake>Tesla</carMake> Model S are the only battery-electric cars in existence with more than 200 miles of range on a charge. Both the Bolt EV and Model S 60 have 60-kW-hr batteries, and have the patriotic bonus of being made in the U.S.A. So, which one is better, given that you could have two Bolts (after federal tax credits) for the price of one Model S 60? Is the <carMake>Tesla</carMake> is actually worth the extra 30 large?
