<carMake>Volkswagen’s</carMake> humble Jetta TDI can’t match those figures, but since the late 1980s, it’s been holding on to one of the most treasured numbers in the automotive industry: zero. As in zero direct competitors. Having a segment to itself is every automaker’s dream, and last year, <carMake>Volkswagen</carMake> leveraged that zero into 29,805 sales.

With interest in diesel cars growing due to rising fuel-economy awareness, <carMake>GM</carMake> has stuffed the 2014 Cruze compact with a 2.0-liter diesel from its Opel parts bin, added a urea-injection system to meet U.S. emissions regulations, and plopped it down right across from <carMake>Volkswagen’s</carMake> banana stand. Its 151 horsepower beats the <carMake>VW’s</carMake> by 11, and its 280 pound-feet of torque beats <carMake>VW’s</carMake> count by 44. In the minus column are the Chevrolet’s extra 232 pounds, due in part to the urea exhaust-treatment equipment, which the Jetta lacks (it’s clean enough to meet our emissions standards without it). <carMake>Chevy</carMake> hangs a higher price tag on the Cruze but throws in more standard gear, including an automatic transmission.
