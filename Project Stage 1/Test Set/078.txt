The mid-engined, two-plus-two Evora configuration is an anomaly (as long as <carMake>Lamborghini</carMake> continues to not build a Urraco). The price of this <carMake>Lotus</carMake>—$74,675 base, $85,270 as tested—lines up with the <carMake>Nissan</carMake> GT-R’s and the bottom end of the <carMake>Porsche</carMake> 911 Carrera range, but those cars don’t feel like proper competitors somehow. The Evora aims for chassis feel above straight-line times, light weight over complexity, and a connection with the driver above all else. While it nevertheless makes concessions to cabin comfort, the Evora couldn’t more concisely define British sports-car-ness if it were wearing string-back gloves, a tweed cap, and women’s underwear.
