When <carMake>Ford</carMake> sold all but a symbolic slice of its stake in <carMake>Mazda</carMake> in 2010, it ended one of the longest-running, most successful automotive collaborations in history. <carMake>Mazda’s</carMake> chassis expertise and <carMake>Ford’s</carMake> engine know-how produced lively, nimble cars, none more significant than the 2000 <carMake>Ford</carMake> Focus. Built on a <carMake>Mazda</carMake> platform that wouldn’t be used by the Japanese automaker for another three years, that Focus landed on our 10Best list five times and initiated the industry-wide race to build compacts that enthusiasts want.
