Amid the industry’s booming sales of compact wagonoids on stilts, domestic full-size SUVs stand out like the mountains of metal they are: truck-based behemoths capable of towing more than four tons while seating up to eight people. Despite their excesses, these giants remain indispensable for their vast range of capabilities. While both of the segment’s icons, the <carMake>Chevrolet</carMake> Tahoe and the <carMake>Ford</carMake> Expedition, see a significant evolution for 2015, each applies its own formula for taking an entire homestead on holiday.

The Tahoe follows the path of the latest <carMake>Chevy</carMake> Silverado 1500, borrowing its updated boxed frame and 5.3-liter small-block V-8 with aluminum block-and-head construction, direct fuel injection, variable valve timing, and cylinder deactivation. Its 355 horsepower and 383 pound-feet of torque motivate a stylish, if conventional, rig that stands apart from the donor pickup with more of its own sheetmetal and rear coils instead of leaf springs. In a first for the ute, even its front doors are different from the Silverado’s.
