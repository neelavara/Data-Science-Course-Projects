Few luxury offerings have more squarely hit the marketing nail on the head. At the end of its second year, <carMake>Lexus</carMake> was already America’s bestselling luxury-import brand. The LS worked so well that, over the course of the next two decades, it never strayed from its original assignment. In 1989, it wasn’t hip to say “I drive a <carMake>Lincoln</carMake>,” but it almost overnight became hip to say “I drive a <carMake>Lexus</carMake>.” In short, the LS400 made the <carMake>Lexus</carMake> brand, which, by 2009, commanded 17.8 percent of the U.S. luxury market.

Enter <carMake>Hyundai</carMake>. Well, not exactly. We too often label <carMake>Hyundai</carMake> a juvenile upstart, when, in fact, the company set up shop here a quarter-century ago [see timeline]. Even as <carMake>Lexus</carMake> trotted out the LS400, <carMake>Hyundai</carMake> was launching its first Sonata, and we smirked at the Koreans’ too-big-for-their-britches assertion that the Sonata would one day rival Camrys and Accords.
