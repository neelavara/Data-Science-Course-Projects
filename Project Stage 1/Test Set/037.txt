But outright speed doesn’t seem to be this updated GT-R’s primary focus—for 2017, <carMake>Nissan</carMake> has focused on livability. To that end, its structure has been marginally stiffened and its dampers softened. <carMake>Nissan</carMake> added an acoustic windshield and improved sound deadening, and it tweaked the active noise cancellation and engine sound enhancement to work with a new two-mode titanium xhaust. Additionally, <carMake>Nissan</carMake> fitted a new touchscreen nav system as part of a comprehensive interior update to address complaints that the GT-R’s cabin wasn’t reflective of its sticker price. With the passing of time, faster cars have come out, and the GT-R’s performance is no longer so outrageous that it’s immune to criticism. The new cabin is a nicer place to be, though still not up to the standard of other cars with six-figure price tags.
