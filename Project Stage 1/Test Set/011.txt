Thankfully, <carMake>Jeep</carMake>, <carMake>Nissan</carMake>, and <carMake>Subaru</carMake> have entered into this no man’s land of budget-friendly crossovers that straddle the unclaimed dimensionality between subcompact and compact crossovers with the <carMake>Jeep</carMake> Compass, <carMake>Nissan</carMake> Rogue Sport, and <carMake>Subaru</carMake> Crosstrek. Bonus: All three are new to the market this year.
The new <carMake>Jeep</carMake> Compass Trailhawk is the most off-road-capable trim level of the second-generation Compass lineup. Built on <carMake>Fiat</carMake> Chrysler Automobile’s Small-Wide 4×4 architecture, the Compass straddles the gap between the subcompact Renegade and compactish Cherokee.
