Large luxury cars used to be powered by throaty, grumbling eight-cylinder engines. <carMake>Cadillac</carMake> had its old Northstar V-8s, <carMake>Mercedes-Benz</carMake> a 4.3-liter, and <carMake>Volvo</carMake> a 4.4-liter V-8 in the mid-priced offerings. But downsizing is all the rage these days, and all three of those manufacturers’ new mid-priced offerings are powered by diminutive 2.0-liter four-cylinder engines. Our testing suggests that you might not miss those extra cylinders.
