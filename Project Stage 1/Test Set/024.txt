The <carMake>Ford</carMake>’s engine is a firecracker, too. Powered by a 2.3-liter turbocharged I-4, the Focus RS has 350 ponies to play with and the most torque of the group at 350 lb-ft. There’s surprisingly little lag from the engine and a ton of midrange torque even when cruising along the highway in top gear. The six-speed manual gearbox is nimble and precise; it’s the type of gearbox you shift not because you have to but because the shifter is so enjoyable to row.
