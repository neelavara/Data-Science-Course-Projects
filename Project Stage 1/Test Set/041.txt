Conversely, the <carMake>Lexus</carMake> RX 350 was unanimously dubbed the best place to rest your bum. Supple leather, excellent contouring, and standard heated/ventilated front seats outperformed on long, steady drives. The firmer <carMake>Mercedes</carMake> front seats (just heated) with their stable side-bolsters were preferred on meandering roads. The <carMake>Lincoln</carMake>’s $1,500 optional 22-way power driver’s seat with massage would appear to be the throne of choice, but it was no match for those in the <carMake>Lexus</carMake> or <carMake>Mercedes</carMake>. The MKX’s driver’s seat in particular felt as if we were sitting on the seat rather than in it. In fact, the <carMake>Lincoln</carMake>’s seat was at its most comfortable only while it was in massage mode, yet it groaned and creaked like an old rocking chair. Even its seat ventilation fans made audible whirring sounds. Right idea, <carMake>Lincoln</carMake>, but poor execution.
