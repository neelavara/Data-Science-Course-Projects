It’s tough living in the shadows, but <carMake>Ford</carMake> has done its best to ensure the new-for-2018 Expedition gets its chance at the spotlight. Our 2018 <carMake>Ford</carMake> Expedition XLT 4×4, like all new Expeditions, is built with lessons learned developing the best-selling, Truck of the Year–winning <carMake>Ford</carMake> F-150. Its sleek new sheetmetal is made of aluminum, and under the hood it sports a 3.5-liter twin-turbo V-6 paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission and optional all- or four-wheel drive—our tester is equipped with the latter.
Big full-size SUVs aren’t just an American thing; <carMake>Toyota</carMake> has been playing in the segment since 2000 with the Sequoia. Although largely unchanged since it made its debut in 2008, <carMake>Toyota</carMake> gave it a handful of updates for the new year. Our 2018 <carMake>Toyota</carMake> Sequoia TRD Sport 4×4 is the newest trim level, and it, like the rest of the lineup, gets LED headlights and some infotainment updates this year. Despite the Sequoia’s new nose, under the hood it soldiers on with a 5.7-liter V-8 paired with a six-speed auto and optional four-wheel drive.
