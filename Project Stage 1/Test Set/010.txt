Those compact SUVs have evolved with us. Take a look at what was offered in the early 2000s. Vehicles such as the <carMake>Jeep</carMake> Cherokee, <carMake>Nissan</carMake> Xterra, and <carMake>Subaru</carMake> Forester all proudly sported city-friendly dimensions and some real off-road capability. But their modern equivalents have grown by a half-foot or more, ballooning not only in size but also in price.
Although a new generation of subcompact crossovers could seemingly backfill that size and price gap, most are still smaller than yesteryear’s compacts—and their on-road comfort and off-road credentials, in some cases, are suspect.
