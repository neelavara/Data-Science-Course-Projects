Similar ride and handling trade-offs were the rule among the <carMake>Lexus</carMake>, <carMake>Jaguar</carMake>, <carMake>Mercedes</carMake>, and <carMake>Audi</carMake>. The <carMake>Lexus</carMake> handles nicely and rides well, but its portly curb weight made it feel heavy and dulled its responses. The <carMake>Jaguar</carMake> and <carMake>Mercedes</carMake> handled very well, but rubber-band tires and stiff shocks hurt their ride quality. The <carMake>Audi</carMake> both handled and rode very well, but the experience was very isolated and disconnected from the road. Many an editor likened it to a driving simulator.
