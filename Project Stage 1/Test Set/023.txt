The Alpina’s rear subframe is isolated from the chassis with bushings, and as such, its occupants experience less road and impact noise. Although it rides on the same-size 20-inch wheels, the Alpina’s ride is far more supple than the M6’s. It soaks up bumps that have the M car bouncing and pogoing. Although its steering ratio is far slower (18.7:1 versus 12.7:1), the Alpina setup offers better on-center communication because it dances in your hands the way good <carMake>BMW</carMake> steering used to. The M6, by comparison, is mute on center, allowing the car to tramline to truck grooves, pavement seams, and the gravitational pull of Neptune.
