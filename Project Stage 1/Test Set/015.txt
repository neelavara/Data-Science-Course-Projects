But what is past is prologue. These days, even the entry-level iterations offer up actual sporty good times. And the midgrade versions—Camaro SS and Mustang GT—can bloody the lip of Europe’s finest. For not a ton of coin, either. Then you have the even more potent and more track-focused stuff, the battle that has raged for 50 years. You need your biggest guns; you want to go into battle with your heaviest weapons. For team Camaro, that’s the ZL1. For the <carMake>Ford</carMake> Performance folks, it’s none other than the Shelby GT350R. These are extreme machines, in both monstrous function and opulent excrescence.
Also, I’d counter that this is a pretty damn good comparison test. At this moment in time, the GT350R is the highest-performing ponycar <carMake>Ford</carMake> makes, and the same is true in regard to the Chevy. They are the beasts atop the food chain, so to speak. Also, in terms of price, they’re right on top of each other. The white ZL1 pictured here stickers for $65,230. The much more limited-production blue and black striped Shelby R: $68,020.
