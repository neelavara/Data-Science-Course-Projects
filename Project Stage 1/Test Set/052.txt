The first <carMake>BMW</carMake> M3, that little snarly sweetheart E30 from the Reagan years, didn’t invent its genre. There were heroic versions of otherwise mainstream cars long before it, starting with the Cosworth Vega and <carMake>VW</carMake> Golf GTI. Well, actually, starting with the Pontiac GTO. No, really, starting with the <carMake>Chevy</carMake> II Nova Super Sport. Okay, fine, starting with the 1949 Olds “Rocket” 88. Discussion closed. But while the M3 wasn’t a new idea, through successive generations of sublimity it became a benchmark for a narrow niche: practical sports sedans with enhanced capability. They’re fast but also reasonably roomy and road-trip comfortable. That segment, let’s call it compact radar bait, is now so formulaic that our three cars, the current M3 and the new <carMake>Cadillac</carMake> ATS-V and <carMake>Mercedes-AMG</carMake> C63 S, are all but track-sheet clones of each other.
