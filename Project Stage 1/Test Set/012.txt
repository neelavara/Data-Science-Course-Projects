Each is the most capable off-road truck its respective Detroit maker builds, and each brings unique capabilities. The Chevy is a Frankenstein’s monster of locking differentials for rock-crawling along with Baja-bred suspension wizardry. The high-flying Raptor is designed for going fast where things shouldn’t be able to. And the <carMake>Ram</carMake>—well, it’s got a freakin’ winch hanging off its front bumper. Our top pick would have to be unstoppable off-road, and because half of off-roading is getting to the trails in the first place, it would also have to be great on-road.
About 380 miles and eight hours separate us and our scheduled stop by the Daniel-Johnson Dam (formerly Manic-5) in northern Quebec, and I’m eager to get at it, so I snag the keys to the Colorado before we pull out of our hotel lot. I hadn’t driven the ZR2 before today, so I’m eager to see how it stacks up against the Z71.
