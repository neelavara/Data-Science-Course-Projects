Each time we do this contest, we prepare for the onslaught of correspondence written in capital letters declaring the Corvette the outright winner, simply due to its price advantage. Yes, the <carMake>Porsche</carMake> is expensive. It’s a fact of life. We’ve argued in the past the 911’s superiority as a vehicle justifies the price difference. Your bank account may vary.
