If their mutual ruddiness is not a firm enough basis for a comparison test between a 24-year-old, mid-engined, flat-12 <carMake>Ferrari</carMake> supercar and America’s favorite son, then consider that virtually everyone in the greater Los Angeles area mistook our Torch Red Corvette Stingray for a <carMake>Ferrari</carMake>. Sure, it’s possible that no one currently living in the L.A. basin has ever seen a <carMake>Chevrolet</carMake> ­passenger car, but still.

Also, a nice 1990 <carMake>Ferrari</carMake> Testarossa—perhaps not quite as nice as our original-owner example, but decent—can be had for about $62,000, within striking distance of this $65,480 Stingray coupe equipped with the Z51 Performance package. And look, it’s been a dream of mine since my pimple-faced, MG Midget–driving teen years to get just a taste of this quintessential ’80s supercar. It was the car that I imagined Wall Street types would drive from hostile takeover deals to orgies with the women from Patrick Nagel illustrations. Detestable yuppies they might have been, but man, their hair was feathered so much more luxuriantly than my own. So please, let me have this moment.
