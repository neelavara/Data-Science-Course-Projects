Radically redesigned this year, the <carMake>Chevy</carMake> Maltipoo, er, Malibu has its name written on the front doors in widely spaced movie-theater-marquis letters, as if a David Lean epic is about to open. To keep the prices real, we opted for the base engines on all the cars in this test. While the others here have conventionally breathing four-cylinder engines displacing 2.4 to 2.5 liters, the Malibu goes turbo right off the bat with a blown 1.5-liter. Our LT is a couple of steps up from the ­bottom, and as equipped is the most expensive car here at $27,940. However, knock off the $1150 sunroof that we opened just once, to make sure it did open, and the Malibu would be the second-cheapest car in this test.

We’re always extolling the <carMake>Honda</carMake> Accord, and its near-perennial status as a 10Best winner ensures its place in this test as the high castle for everyone else to throw rocks at. The version to buy is the Sport manual, but as this is a slush-only test, we took this opportunity to live for a while with the optional continuously variable transmission. A CVT is as far as you can possibly get from a manual unless your car has hydrostatic drive. The Accord doesn’t, but it does offer a Sensing package with a bunch of anti-collision systems that add a grand to the price. Even so, at $26,900, this Accord Sport represents the second-lowest price.

<carMake>Mazda’s</carMake> 6 is always a sales underdog, a brand-B pick that is still built in Japan and still living in the shadows of giants. More than seven <carMake>Toyota</carMake> Camrys get sold for every <carMake>Mazda</carMake> 6. But the 6 is a former comparo winner and 10Best awardee. If the Malibu is to earn space on the zestier side of the family-car menu, it’s the 6 that it will have to contend with. The current 6 debuted in 2014 but got an update for 2016 that includes a fancier interior. Of the three trim levels available, our Touring is the middle one, with a 184-hp 2.5-liter four and a six-speed automatic. Our sleek test car arrived with just one option: $300 Soul Red paint.
