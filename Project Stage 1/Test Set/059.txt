These two sedans have more in common than just a chance encounter on the price curve. We’ve brought together a new <carMake>Subaru</carMake> WRX and a used <carMake>Audi</carMake> S4 because both have similar lineages, with four-wheel-drive systems whose roots extend back to the rally stage. They have similar performance, too: Both post nearly identical sub-five-second zero-to-60 times, mid-13-second quarter-miles, and mid-0.90-g roadholding numbers. But there’s something equally fundamental linking the two, and it is neither mechanical nor dynamic. It is the kinship of disappointment.

At the announcement of the 2010 <carMake>Audi</carMake> S4 and its 333-hp, supercharged 3.0-liter V-6, fans of the 2004–2008 S4’s 340-hp V-8 called out the new car for its lowered cylinder count, often in ways not even appropriate for the modern-day locker room. The WRX debuted this year to its own cool reception. Its live-bait styling, stagnant power rating, and common Impreza platform underwhelmed enthusiasts expecting something closer to the WRX concept shown at the 2013 New York auto show.
