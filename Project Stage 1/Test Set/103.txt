For decades, <carMake>Subaru</carMake> has been perfecting the craft of equipping all-wheel drive to 
nearly every product in its portfolio. Wanting to evaluate this claim for myself, 
I decided to pit the Legacy against the 2015 <carMake>Mazda</carMake>, another efficient mid-size sedan.
Frequently beating its competitor’s all-wheel drive setups with better packaging and 
efficiency, <carMake>Subaru</carMake> has a new target in sight.
