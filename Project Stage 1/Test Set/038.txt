Now <carMake>Acura</carMake> has come along, and it’s pushing the “everyday supercar” mantra. That means a lovely interior, but the NSX’s daily drivability goes way beyond that. <carMake>Acura</carMake> chose to outfit its supercar with workaday summer tires, selected for their ability to plow through deep rainwater puddles in cold weather rather than for their outright grip. If that seems like an unusual compromise, consider the “quiet” mode that helps avoid making a scene. Or the purposefully numb steering, engineered to relieve the tedium of driving. Or even the understeer supposedly built into the chassis’ Normal drive mode in the name of safety.
