Can I see a show of hands for all of the <carMake>Tesla</carMake> Model 3 reservation holders out there? Now drop your hand if you’re put off when I tell you that the one Motor Trend tested is a big-battery ($9,000), “premium features” ($5,000) Long Range version that stickers for $60,500. Mostly shrugged shoulders? You know how <carMake>Tesla</carMake> rolls, then. Although the base price on the window sticker in fact reads “$36,000,” we get the loaded version to test. Just like any premium automaker, the high-profit versions get delivered first.
Now how about everybody who is serious about plunging into a long-range electric car but doesn’t have the stomach for <carMake>Tesla</carMake>’s financial roller coaster? Quite a few. That means you’re picking between two other recent entrants: the 238-mile <carMake>Chevrolet</carMake> Bolt EV (last year’s Motor Trend Car of the Year) or the redesigned, 150-mile <carMake>Nissan</carMake> Leaf—both of which we’re comparing here to the Model 3. By the way, any of you buying the Chevy or <carMake>Nissan</carMake> with profit you made off of <carMake>Tesla</carMake> stock? Just kidding. Sort of.
