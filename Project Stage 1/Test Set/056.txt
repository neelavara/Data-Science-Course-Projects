In Los Angeles County, and particularly on the ocean side of the I-405 freeway, eco-awareness is the highest virtue. The <carMake>Tesla</carMake> Model S is the halo car, and most cabs are Priuses. ChargePoint.com’s online locator lists a staggering 49 electric-car chargers in Century City, the 176-acre high-end westside district built on what was once the back lot of 20th Century Fox. That’s 15 more chargers than the whole 49.5-million-acre state of Nebraska can claim.

There isn’t any place in North America more eager or ready for the all-electric <carMake>BMW</carMake> i3 and <carMake>Mercedes-Benz</carMake> B-class Electric Drive than trendy, liberal, and prosperous West L.A. But, as electric cars with less than 100 miles of range, the i3 and the B are constrained by a tight support system. The public chargers in populated areas are often in facilities where the parking is expensive. C/D paid only $1.16 per car in electricity to charge the <carMake>BMW</carMake> and <carMake>Mercedes</carMake> at a port in Century City, but the building dinged us another $35 each for parking.
