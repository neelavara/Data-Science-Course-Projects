Both cars offer a single USB port and 12-volt power point in front of the gearshift knobs, then more plug-ins in the center console cubby. <carMake>Toyota</carMake> also provides a standard wireless phone charger, but <carMake>Honda</carMake>’s is available on higher trims only. Both offer heated seats, though top-trim Touring Accords also offer ventilated seats, which the Camry does not. The Camry features two fast-charging USB ports but only on higher trim levels. Lower trims get only the one port up front for the entire car. Above, Camry offers a panoramic sunroof to the Accord’s standard sunroof. When it’s time to gas up, the Accord comes equipped with a capless fuel filler, which the Camry lacks.
Have friends or family who need to climb in the rear seats? Both cars are commodious, but the Accord is roomy like a parlor, particularly in kneeroom and headroom. If you tick the box for the aforementioned huge sunroof on the Camry, those in back suffer greatly reduced headroom.
