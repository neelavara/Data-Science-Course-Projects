Back in 2008, <carMake>Chrysler</carMake> was a financial boat anchor bumping along the bottom and looking to spin off the Viper’s nuts, bolts, and name for quick cash. Just imagine the underfunded, underdeveloped, barn-built horror that the poor slobs of some other universe must endure because there, <carMake>Chrysler</carMake> found some rich guys who wanted to take a shot at the car business. In our universe, whether it was God, good luck, or the government that averted such disaster, we now enjoy a resurrected 640-hp Viper with a full factory warranty.

The Corvette also faced its own mortality during <carMake>GM’s</carMake> recent existential crisis. But in this universe, it lives on in a seventh ­generation starting later this year. While we await the many permutations of the C7, including (we hope) another ZR1, we wanted to see how the new Viper rates against its arch nemesis and direct com­peti­tor for the title of America’s foremost supercar, the one that best brings big-bore raucousness into modernity.
