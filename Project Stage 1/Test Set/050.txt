As it was in the beginning, so it is now: Just like in the ’60s, <carMake>Ford’s</carMake> Mustang success has <carMake>Chevrolet</carMake> playing catch-up with its new Camaro. The Chevy V-8 now turns out an additional 29 horsepower, but it’s clear that the engineers directed most of their energy toward the chassis. Reborn on <carMake>GM’s</carMake> Alpha platform, the new, sixth-generation Camaro uses the same core that forms the basis of the German-baiting <carMake>Cadillac</carMake> ATS and CTS. It is lighter and trimmer than the Zeta-platform-based Camaro it replaces and benefits from the suspension and steering expertise that is quickly—and surprisingly—becoming a <carMake>GM</carMake> hallmark.

We left the <carMake>Dodge</carMake> Challenger on the bench for this test. After its third-place finish in our December 2014 comparison, where a similarly equipped Mustang took the gold, we knew where the Challenger would place in this round. If it wants to run with these two athletes, <carMake>Dodge</carMake> needs to cut the fat. The Challenger is more than nine inches longer than either car here and weighs some 400 pounds more.
