While crossovers are all the rage right now, a lot of people still buy midsized sedans like the <carMake>Toyota</carMake> Camry and <carMake>Hyundai</carMake> Sonata 
and hold on to them for hundreds of thousands of miles and several years. With some exciting new updates to these established players in this segment, 
it’s only natural to compare them. It’s easy to say that <carMake>Toyota</carMake> went overboard with the design, 
but I see a lot of Lexus in the bodywork with the big grille and aggressive lines.
