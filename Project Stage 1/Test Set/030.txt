The <carMake>Tesla</carMake> Model S 60 drives much like its higher-powered and longer-range brethren. It may not brutally assault your senses like a Ludicrous-enhanced Model S P90D will, but stomp on the accelerator from a standstill, and the Model S 60 hooks up and rockets forward like only an electric car can. Accelerating from 0 to 60 mph takes this Model S 5.0 seconds, the quarter mile falling in 13.6 seconds at 103.5 mph. Aided by regenerative braking and arguably the best-feeling brakes ever fit to an electric car, the Model S comes to a standstill from 60 mph in 121 feet. The Model S 60 may be slower than <carMake>Tesla</carMake>’s high-performance models, but it can still hang on the figure eight, lapping the course in 26.5 seconds while averaging 0.70 g.
